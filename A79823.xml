            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter <hi>John</hi> hath diſcovered to him the conſederacy and conjunction of Dragon, Beaſt, and Falſe-prophet in their call to and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination with the Kings of the Earth, and whole

                  <p>A Portion of Scripture worthy our moſt ſerious ſearch and enquiry, containing moſt ſeaſonable and neceſſary truths, and of ſuch import, that a late learned Author ſaith thus of it. <hi>That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Cataſtrophe, Reſult, and Deſign of all, that God hath ſpoken before in the Old Teſtament, and no leſs than a Golden Key to unlock the Bible, eſpecially the Old Teſtament.</hi> Though expreſſed in ſuch miſtical Allegories and Types, ſuch Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and Tropical Terms, as makes it very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, and difficult, and to that degree, ſo that <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, that a man may ſee by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary of Interpreters, how greatly they are puzled and toyled in the interpritation of this Chapter, being like an intricate Maze and Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152899:8"/> where there is no winding of a mans ſelf out.

                  <p>Having thus laid down the parts, the next thing to be conſidered and enquired into, is the meaning of the Spirit, and what is held forth to us by this Parabolical, and miſterious Prophecy. <hi>For this Book of the</hi> Revelations (as Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> well obſerves) <hi>is not uſually to be taken accoridng to the Letter only, as of a certain bare Hiſtory of things done, but as a Propheſie involved with Mysteries, Allegories, and Types. Therefore muſt we labour to get a right diſcerning of the meaning of thoſe Parables, and Prophetical Miſteries which for the moſt part are Figurative and Tropical, and in part borrowed from the Condition of affairs under the Old Teſtament,</hi> And that it is alike injurious to truth to take a miſterious Allegory in the Letter, as to make an Allegory of the plain Scripture; to Litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the Allegory, as to Allegorize the Letter.</p>
                  <p>Bernard, p. 130. <hi>As it is compoſed of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, ſo the words are Figurative, the whole Propheſie full of Metaphors, and almoſt altogether Allegorical: ſo as we muſt take heed that we look further than into the Letter and naked Relation of things, as they are ſet down: Otherways the book ſhould be full of abſurdities, impoſſibilities, falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and flat contradictions unto other truths of Scripture, which are far from the words of Gods holy Spirit, which are ever holy and true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For who can believe a Lamb to have ſeven eyes, a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152899:11"/> mountain burning to be caſt into the Sea, and this thereby to become in a third part blood, a ſtar to fall from Heaven, Locuſts to be of ſo monſtrous a ſhape as is ſet down in Chapter</hi> 9 <hi rend="sup">h</hi>, <hi>and Horſes with Lions heads; fire, ſmoke and brimſtone coming out of their mouths; Dragon and Beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore we muſt not stick in the Letter, but ſearch out the Hiſtorical ſenſe, which is the truth intended. Alſo we muſt note this carefully, that all this whole propheſie is framed after the ſtate and condition of the antient people of God, the Jews; and after the words and viſions of the antient Prophets as we may ſee by comparing the words and viſions of this Book with</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, Firſt to their ſufferings under their three Enemies, as</hi> Pharaoh <hi>in</hi> Aegypt <hi>called a Dragon.</hi> 2. <hi>By</hi> Babel <hi>and the Beaſts noted in</hi> Daniel. 3. <hi>By</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog. 2. <hi>To their whole state,</hi> viz. <hi>By the twelve Tribes, the Wilderneſs, Thunder, Lightning, Earthquake, to the Tabernale, the Ark of his Teſtament, the Prieſts, to white Raiment, a Golden girdle about the paps, the Altar, Incenſe, Odours, Lamps, Candleſticks.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152899:12"/> the Expoſition is undoubted and infallible, and ſo will the Revelation be the beſt Expounder of the Revelation, and from thoſe Expoſitions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably borrow light, for the diſcovering of other obſcure paſſages depending thereupon, relating thereto, or contemporaneous therewith: As for inſtance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The miſtery of the ſeven Stars in his right hand, and of the ſeven Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſticks interpreted by Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>The ſeven Stars are the Angels of the ſeven Churches: and the ſeven Candleſticks are the ſeven Churches. So</hi> Rev. 17.7. <hi>The miſtery of the Woman and of the Beaſt that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her, which hath the ſeven heads and ten horns, and of the waters ſhe ſat on,</hi> explained and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Holy Spirit: The Woman is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to be the great City, that then reigned over the Kings of the Earth: And the waters where the Whore ſiteth to be People, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, Nations, and Tongues: The Beaſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven heads to be ſeven Mountains, and ſeven Kings; Ten horns to be ten Kingdoms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which interpretation Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> hath this Remark, <hi>viz. This is ſingular in this place, nor to be paſſed over, with a ſlight obſervation: That this viſion concerning the great Whore and the Beaſt bearing her, is opened to</hi> John <hi>and to us by the Angel (contrary to his wonted manner) with a moſt plain interpretation without boubt to this end, that by the benefit of the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, as being the chiefeſt viſion of all the reſt,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152899:13"/> the other Miſteries contained in the</hi> Revelations, <hi>hitherto indeed ſhut up, but depending upon it with a wonderful Artifice, might be revealed. Here therefore give all attention: and leaſt the Angel ſhould take this pain in vain, as far forth as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth thee: Remember this right well, right well, I ſay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And another thus; <hi>This propheſie thus lively diſcloſed, may deſervedly be ſtiled the Divine Key of the Revelation, whereby many miſteries of this book may be unlocked, and the Top-Tower, or Turret of the</hi> Revelations, <hi>whence the ſecrets of this Book may be peculiarly and certainly diſcovered on every ſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 3. Thirdly, Moſt diligently to obſerve the ſcope, order, and harmony of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we come to conſider the Phraſes and Terms, that call for explanation and unfolding in this Prophecy, which we ſhall take in order as they lye in the ſeveral parts of the Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>Of the Dragon.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt thing to be enquired into, is the great ſubject of this diſcourſe, the Dragon; Who and what he is. The right underſtanding whereof will let us much into the Miſtery of this Prophecy, which therefore obliges to the more diligent ſearch, and greater exactneſs, keeping cloſe to the rules propounded.</p>
                  <p>Dragon, or old Serpent in Scripture is taken in a two-fold ſence; ſometimes in a litteral, <hi>viz.</hi> that Creature, who as ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Was more ſubtile than any beaſt of the field, which the Lord God had made,</hi> held forth to be deſtructive, cruel and devouring, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.34. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.11. poiſonous and murderous, <hi>Deut.</hi> 52.33. <hi>Pſal.</hi>

And ſometimes in a figurative or miſtical ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Great Tyrants, who acting in the Dragons cruel, ſubtile, envious and deſtructive nature, are properly ſo called. Therefore <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that old cruel Enemy of Gods people is called Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9. <hi>Ezck.</hi> 29.3. So alſo <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> that other cruel bloody Enemy, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.34. Alſo the Roman Empire whilſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, ſo murderouſly bloody to the Saints in diſtinction from the Beaſt called Dragon, great Red Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.30. So the Whale or Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than that devouring tyrannous Sea-monſter called Dragon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.13, 14. <hi>Hence the Heatheniſh and Pagan Empire, that bears rule in all the World, as Turk, Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. Is called here in this place Dragon in diſtinction from the Beaſt, that bore ſway only in <hi>Euroep,</hi> and now vanquiſhed and put down, as in the former Chapter, ſo that as the <hi>Pagan Empire</hi> we are to notion Dragon here, <hi>viz.</hi> a State or Empire (as the Beaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted before) not any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But it is ſaid, what need you go ſo far for an interpretation, when you have one ſo near at hand? Is it not here ſaid that he is the Devil and Satan the old Serpent? So alſo</hi> Rev. 12.9. <hi>the ſeven headed, ten horned, red Dragon is called the old Serpent the Devil and Satan, and therefore by Dragon here is not to be underſtood a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152899:14"/> ſtate or conſtitution of Government, as you ſuppoſe; but the Devil himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true the Dragon in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and here alſo is ſaid to be the old Serpent. Devil and Satan; not that he was perſonally ſo, but figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively and repreſentatively; as it is ſaid the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 11.3. which was not the Serpent barely conſidered, but the Devil acting the Serpent: As the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> ſhape or mantle; or when a man is poſſeſſed by the Devil, the man is ſaid to ſpeak and act, when it is the Devil that ſpeaks and acts him: And ſo is the Heathen Empire called the Devil and Satan, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. Where it is ſaid the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon: Not that the Devil in perſon was to do it; But the Devil in his Imps, Agents, Officers, Inſtruments, Vicegerents; And ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. It is ſaid, Satan dwelt and had his ſeat there; not that the Devil actually and viſibly in perſon dwelt there: But the Devil in his Spirit and old enmity acting in his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, the Rulers and Magiſtrates of that place. And well might the Heathen Emperours of old be called the Devil, and Satan that old Serpent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe he as God and Prince of this World, and of the Air the <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon,</hi> King of the bottomleſs pit, having by Gods permiſſion the diſpoſe of the worldly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152899:15"/> (<hi>Luke</hi> 4.6. compared <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7.) is the Head and Soveraign of the Rulers of darkneſs in this world. And therefore are the Beaſtly and dragonical powers ſpringing from him, acting unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him, and being influenced by his Spirit as their Lord and Head, are called Devils by his name; Whereas Gods Rulers, deriving from above, influenced by his Spirit, acting in his name, by his Laws and in his Authority, are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe they acting in that Drago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, ſubtile, tyrannous, bloody ſpirit, even the ſpirit of the Devil, are therefore called the Red Dragon, Devil, and Satan.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Becauſe they ſet up and impoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, the Devils worſhip, not only thereby worſhiping themſelves, but inforcing others to do the ſame, yea to require divine worſhip to be done to themſelves, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the Heathen Emperours of old, falſe worſhip being called the worſhip of Devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21. 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 11.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17. And that by Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is to be underſtood the Heathen Empire or Government, further appears from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation given by Chriſt himſelf in this Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10. Where the ſeven headed and ten horned Beaſt, that had the Crowns upon the horns (the Image as well as ſubſtitute of the Dragon, who had ſeven heads and ten horns alſo, the difference only betwixt them, was, that the Dragon had his Crowns upon his heads;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152899:15"/> which when he reſigned in that part of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to the Beaſt, the Crowns were put upon the hornes) is interpreted by the ſpirit to be civil Empire and power The ten horns are ten Kingdoms, and ſeven heads are ſeven Kings, five of which were fallen before <hi>Johns</hi> time, and one of the ſix of thoſe heads was in <hi>Johns</hi> time, and the ſeventh afterwards to come; and they alſo ſignified ſeven hills interpreted to be that City, that then ruled over the Kings of the Earth, which was no other than <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſeat and Metropolis of the Empire, as it was then ſtanding upon ſeven Mountains.</p>
                  <p>So that the ſeven headed red Dragon and ſeven headed ſcarlet coloured Beaſt, his Image and Succeſſour, in that part of the World, <hi>Europe,</hi> was no other by this interpretation than the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Empire and Rule, that firſt was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen (that drew the third part of the Stars of Heaven, or powers or poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of this world) during the Dragonical ſtate, and in <hi>Rome</hi> Antichriſtian, during the Beaſtly ſtate.</p>
                  <p>And further it appears that by Dragon we are to underſtand here the heathen Empire from the extent of his power and juriſdiction. For it is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13, 14. that the emiſſaries of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Beaſt and Falſe-Prophet go forth unto the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty. The Beaſt and Falſe-Prophets power
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152899:16"/> extend no further than the ten Kingdoms. But it is the Dragon that commands the reſt of the world, deceiving the nations and whole world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9 Therefore it is ſaid of him, after he is looſed again, 20.8. that he goes out again to deceive the Nations, which are in the four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Earth, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> which great army (the number of whom is as the ſand of the Sea) is ſaid to come up upon the breadth of the Earth, and to compaſs the Camp of the Saints: ſo that it appears plainly to be that power that influences and commands, the greater part of the world. And again it appears to be the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Empire or State of Government; becauſe it is judged to the ſame ruine and deſtruction that the Beaſt and Falſe-prophet were (they who were interpreted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. the miniſterial and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial part of Antichriſt) and ſaid to be taken and caſt alive into the lake of Fire und Brimſtone, <hi>viz.</hi> that frame of Rule and Government, as utterly to be cancelled, reverſt, and vacated, and never any more to appear in this world; ſo is the Dragonical, Satanical ſtate, being adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſame lake of Fire and Brimſtone with the Beaſt and Falſe-prophet, utterly alſo damned and deſtroyed, never any more to appear in the world.</p>
                  <p>And again it appears to be no leſs, if you examine thr ſcope of the place and order of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>
                  <p>The ſcope of the Book is to ſhew as the riſe and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152899:16"/> rage, ſo eſpecially the ruine of the Enemies of Chriſt, and his Church in order to their triumph and Glory, which is excellently held forth by Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> in his Intereſt of States and Nations in that brief Epitome he gives of the <hi>Revelations:</hi> Which Book (ſaith he) is a Tragi-comedy beginning with a Kingdom, given to be won by conqueſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8. and ending with a Corronation of a King and the Marriage of his Bride; and all between is but the removing of all ſuch lets and impediments as ſtand in the way. Now the principal Enemies that Chriſt and his Church hath to deal with, are held forth under the types and terms of a Dragon, Beaſt and Falſe-prophet. The Dragon acts two parts one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the riſe of the Beaſt, and another preſently upon and after the Beaſts fall. The twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gives an account of the victory that <hi>Michael</hi> obtained over him, when he was caſt out of Heaven into the Earth, upon which he reſigned up his power, ſeat and authority unto the Beaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in thoſe territories for 42. Months, or 1260. days or years.</p>
                  <p>At the latter end of the Beaſts or Antichriſts Dominion, <hi>viz.</hi> under the ſixth Vial, there is a confederacy and combination of Dragon, Beaſt and Falſe-prophet to gather the Kings of the Earth and whole world to the Battle of the great Day of God Almighty: Accordingly they are aſſembled and ingage Battle with Chriſt and his followers; (not that we are to ſuppoſe that all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152899:17"/> the world, <hi>viz.

Chriſt being their head and repreſentative, and the rather ſo, becauſe it is a power and authority in oppoſition to the Dragon, who is a miſtical repreſentative of all the Enemies of Chriſt; it being no new thing to repreſent a whole party by the head and chief, that influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them: As to ſay ſuch a King vanquiſhed ſuch a King, when neither of the Kings are perſonally preſent, but vertually ſo by their commiſſions, impowring their Generals and Armies.

                  <p>So are the Bloody, Tyrannous, Antichriſtian powers, that for 1260. years are to oppoſe the Church, repreſented by a Beaſt. And the filthy Idolatrous Church by a lewd filthy Strumpet, a whoriſh Woman: and the true Church of Chriſt by a Woman,</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe this is not the time of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal coming and appearing, which will not be till a thouſand years after; for this action is but at the beginning of the thouſand years: His per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal coming is not to be till the Judgment day: It being ſaid, that he mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> not to ſuch work as this; not to fight and ſubdue Enemies with material Swords, nor to put his people as the Lambs Army and followers upon any ſuch ſervice at that time, being then all to be in the Reſurrection and glorified ſtate made like himſelf in glory, and as the Angels of God. Neither will any of his Enemies be in a capacity to make reſiſtance, or oppoſition, who in their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152899:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> own perſons ſhall be deſtroyed by fire, and the very earth they inhabit, and all its works burnt up and conſumed, at whoſe preſence the Earth and Heaven flye away.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe ſuch an apprehenſion would make three perſonal comings of Chriſt. whereas we read but of two (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28.) who will appear the ſecond time without ſin to Salvation.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This conquering, fighting work is not by Chriſt in perſon at this time of his glorious and terrible appearing; becauſe the Execution then upon the Enemies will be ſudden and ſpeedy like travail upon a Woman with Child; as a Thief in the night; like Lightning; as it was in the days of <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> with ſudden deſtruction: and as a ſnare will he come upon all the Inhabitants of the Earth Whereas this work (as you have heard) is a work of time, gradually to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. The ſtone ſmites not the Image all at once, but gradually, and after ſmiting beats him to powder, and blows it away: Then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees doth that little ſtone increaſe to be a great mountain, and to fill the whole Earth: firſt the ten Kingdoms in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Beaſt hath ruled, muſt be overcome in order to Whores judging, for which there is Hallelujah aad Praiſe by all the Saints: After that is the Dragon to be dealt with, <hi>viz.</hi> The Heathen power and rule all the world
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152899:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> through; for all the Kingdoms of this world are to become the Kingdoms of our Lord and his Chriſt; this therefore asks time, the other is done at an inſtant, ſuddenly, at the ſounding of a Trump, in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Neither can Chriſts perſonal appearing, be at this time, becauſe then it muſt be ſuppoſed, that Chriſt being in the Camp of the Saints and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved City ſhall ſuffer himſelf, and all the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels and glorified Saints to be beſieged and ſtreightned by the <hi>Gog-Magog</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>Therfore muſt this be done by his virtual preſence power and ſpirit (though ſpoken, as if he did it in perſon) and theſe great Conqueſts effected, as in the foregoing Chapter is expreſſed by the Sword coming out of his mouth, <hi>viz.</hi> by his word, commiſſion, in his name, and by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>But by what ways will the Lord effect this work upon the Enemy?</p>
                  <p>Various will be the ways and means, that this great work of removing this oppoſition and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing theſe Enemies be brought to paſs, as the Scripture plentifully makes mention, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sometimes by appearing againſt them in ſome extraordinary way of his providence, either after the manner of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by ingaging the Hoſt of Heaven and Stars in their courſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by Hail-ſtones and Coals of fire, as at Mount <hi>Perizim,</hi> or as in the Vally of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon.</hi>

                  <p>Or Secondly, ſometimes in an ordinary way, by confounding, diſpiriting, dividing them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them one againſt the othet, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.2.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.46.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152899:27"/> Dragon be in Heaven, or caſt out of Heaven, being neither capable of the material Heaven, nor the Spiritual Heaven the Church: therefore no other but the figurative or metaphorical Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in which he reſided, and out of which upon <hi>Michaels</hi> cornbate and overthrow he is thus caſt out) ſo is he here not only depoſed and dethroned, but ſo kept down during the thouſand years reign, as if he was ſhut up a cloſe priſoner in a Dungeon or pit.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſence, Earth, Sea, Deep, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temleſs pit are much of the ſame ſignification, the Earth being founded upon the Sea.

                  <p>For during the ſaid term, all Empire and Rule is taken from him, and he is not onely caſt into

                  <head>Of the thouſand years.</head>
                  <p>COncerning the thouſand years ſo often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this Chapter we ſhall make this three-fold enquiry. Firſt, How we are to take it, whether definitely or indefinitely. Secondly, If definitely, whether only one ſpace of time is intended, where a thouſand years is ſo expres'd ſix ſeveral times. And Thirdly, If ſo, when thoſe thouſand years are ſaid to begin and end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, whether to take that number of years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely for a great ſpace of time, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.7. <hi>A thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand.</hi> So Pſal. 90.4. <hi>A thouſand years are in thy ſight, but as yeſtarday, when it is paſt as a watch in the night for a great while,</hi> 1 Sam. 18.7. Saul <hi>hath ſlain his thouſands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands;</hi> that is, <hi>David</hi> many more than <hi>Saul,</hi> not juſt ſo many.</p>
                  <p>Or definitely, for the certain expreſs time as here mentioned? I conclude the latter for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe, that when there is no neceſſity to take a Scripture in a figurative ſenſe, we are to receive it in the Letter, but neither the ſcope of the place, Analogy of Faith, or other Scriptures lay any ſuch neceſſity upon us, therefore ſo to take it.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:152899:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe this ſame ſpace is ſo often repeated by the ſpirit, to which we ſhould take the more earneſt heed, as matter of inſtruction and information; for thrice it is ſaid, Satan was bound a thouſand years and afterwards looſed, 2. 3. 7. Twice it is ſaid the Saints ſhall reign a thouſand years, <hi>verſe</hi> 4.6. Once that the reſt of the dead lived not again till the thouſand years fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. There being a thouſand years of Satans Captivity and the Reſt of dead; and a thouſand years of the Saints Reigning with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>If ſo, then Secondly, Whether theſe intend one and the ſame ſpace of time or no;</p>
                  <p>That one and the ſame ſpace of time is hereby intended is manifeſt, as <hi>Pareus</hi> well obſerves: Becauſe in <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and 6. the thouſand years are without an Article, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, theſe thouſand years emphatically. As if he ſhould ſay, Satans impriſonment ſhall continue a thouſand years, and during theſe thouſand years, the Martyrs ſhall live and reign with Chriſt, and afterwards he ſhall be looſed. The parts to which this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is applied, are ſo cemented together as Cauſe and Effect, diſtinction and oppoſition that they very much ſtrengthen and prove that juſt account of a thouſand years, <hi>viz.</hi> Satan is bound a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, that he ſhould not deceive the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till the ſame thouſand years be fulfilled: Then the Saints lived and reigned a thouſand years
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:152899:29"/> with Chriſt, that ſame thouſand years: But the reſt of the dead lived not again, untill theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years were finiſhed; whilſt the holy ones as their happineſs made Prieſts of God and of Chriſt, Reign with Chriſt a thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>And as to the third, when theſe thouſand years begin and end, we have this general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>That it is the ſpace of time, that is bounded with two Wars, that of the great Battle of God Almighty before it begins: And that of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> after it is ended, being a time of eaſe, peace and reſt as before.</p>
                  <p>A ſpace of time, that hath the Beaſts deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and judgment, the Dragons overthrow, binding and impriſonment going before, and the dragons releaſe and final doom and judgment going after.</p>
                  <p>A ſpace of time containing the ſounding of the ſeventh (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15.) Trumpet, the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> the Bride of the Lamb; (21, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.) the new Heavens and the new Earth, the Palme-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multitude out of all Nations, Tribes, People and Tongues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9. till the War and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Gog,</hi> perſonal coming of Chriſt, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Heaven and Earth, general Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and judgment.</p>
                  <p>A ſpace of time bounded with two Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> the miſtical or figurative Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church out of her death and ſlaughter called the firſt Reſurrection; and the Corporeal
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152899:30"/> Reſurrection at the leſt day. And with two deaths, <hi>viz.</hi> that miſtical death of the Reſt of the Dead, <hi>viz.</hi> the wicked that live not all the thouſand years, and the Eternal death which will be their doom after the thouſand years; with two Lifes, the miſtical of the Church in the thouſand years, and the Eternal Life and Glory to be their portion at Chriſts perſonal coming after the thouſand years. And with two judgments, that of the Beaſt and Falſe-prophet with their followers before; and that of the Dragon and his followers with all the wicked after.</p>
                  <p>But when particularly as to preciſe time theſe thouſand years ſhall begin, is yet a ſecret the Lamb hath not diſcovered, contained in the ſealed Book; all being as yet at a loſs, as to the certain <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Apocalyptick numbers, either as to the forty two Months or 1260, days or years of the Beaſts Reign, or the Churches entring the Wilderneſs which God in his due time will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>

                  <p>IN the interpretation of this miſtry of the living of the Martyrs, Writers and Commentators much differ; ſome judging this to be a Corporeal Reſurrection: others (and they not a few) conceive it to be a ſpiritual Reſurrection, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and reviving of Soul, the effect of Chriſts Spirit upon the heart of Believers and faithful Witneſſes; and a leaving others to a ſtate of ſin and death.</p>
                  <p>But it is humbly conceived, the mind of the Spirit here it is a miſtical Reſurrection, or civil life; they are ſaid to live, as moſt conſonant to Truth, ſound Reaſon, and the ſcope of the place. <hi>They lived.</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152899:31"/> bloody Beaſt and Scarlet coloured Whore; much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in a civil ſenſe, thruſt down from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all power, dignity and Soveraignty in the behalf of Chriſt, either in Civils or Eccleſiaſticks, So was it with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> in theſe reſpects. as perſons put into their Graves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.12 as ſo many dead men.</p>
                  <p>But now is the time come (their Mortal dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enemies being brought down by an high hand) that they ſhall not only have all the bloody Laws and Decrees reverſt, and cancelled, and ſo be freed from all danger or damage, that may come to their perſons: But be revived to a civil life, and put now into a capacity to come into the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of power, dignity and Soveraignty, both in Church and State; for as is the Death, ſo the Reſurrection. Therefore is it ſaid, that when <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and reſtored to former priviledges in their own Land, the Lord opened their Graves, cauſed Bone to come to its Bone, Sinew to its Sinew, put a Spirit of Life into them, ſet them upon their feet, to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an exceeding great Army, whereby they came again to the exerciſe of their former Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions in Rule and Government among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And ſo a parrallel place to this <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. The Church having paſſed the State of Death, Slain, Slaughtered Witneſſes during the Beaſts reign and rage, comes now to have a Spirit of Life from God enter into them, enabling them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:152899:32"/> to ſtand upon their feet. And then a voice from Heaven, or the Orb of Government and Rule (for ſo Heaven here, and in the <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7. is to be taken) calls them up thereto, alluding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Chriſts dead body that was killed, raiſed, and aſcended into Heaven, And ſo the Prophet, Iſa. 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe: Awake and Sing, ye that dwell in the Dust; for thy Dew is as the Dew of Herbs, and the Earth ſhall caſt out the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And parallel to this, Hoſea 6.2. <hi>After two days he will revive us; in the third day he will raiſe us, and we ſhall live in his ſight. His miſtical body the Church being in a miſtical way to conform and ſuit in a figure to the Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of his real Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> alſo in the 13, 14. <hi>ver.</hi> foretelling this promiſed reſtauration to the Church in this miſtical manner, doth it in terms alluding to the Corporeal Reſurrection, to which alſo the Apoſtle refers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. when he aſſerts that Doctrine of the Reſurrection. <hi>I will ranſom them from the power of the Grave, I will redeem them from Death: O Death, I will be thy Plagues; O Grave, I will be thy deſtruction: Repentance ſhall be hid from my Eyes.</hi> And again by the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8. Speaking of this very time. <hi>He will ſwallow up Death in Victory, and the Lord will wipe away tears from all faces, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of his people ſhall he take away from off all the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:152899:32"/> Earth; for the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Which very words of the Prophet are repeated by <hi>John,</hi> and applied to this very time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Now as is the Death, ſo muſt the Reſurrection be: to the Spiritual Death there is a Spiritual Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the miſtical Death a miſtical Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the Corporeal Death a Corporeal Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Aſſemblies Annotations upon this place ſeem to concur alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.5, 6. <hi>After Antichriſts deſtruction there will be ſuch a new face of the Church, as if the Saints were all raiſed up again. This Reſurrection is not of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but of whole Churches and Nations, as</hi> Rom. 11.15. <hi>alluded to in the raiſing of dead Bones,</hi> Ezek 37. <hi>in which they are ſaid to have part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the Corporeal Reſurrection of the Saints cannot be underſtood in this place, further appears.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Text in the Letter of it ſpeaks not of their Bodies, but Souls, and of the Souls only of them that were beheaded, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9. <hi>And I ſaw under the Altar the Souls of them, that were ſlain for the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi> Now it is no where ſaid, that Souls in a proper ſenſe revive and are raiſed; becauſe they never dye being Immortal, and ſo not capable of Reſurrection; neceſſitating therefore another ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe if we are here to underſtand a bodily Reſurrection of the Saints (Martyrs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152899:33"/> only being here mentioned and beheaded Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs too, taking in no other Saints and only ſuch too, that ſuffered under Antichriſt) then will Chriſt have but a ſmall Kingdom: And then only ſuch Martyrs partaking of that firſt Reſurrection are to ſhare of happineſs and freedom from ſecond Death; excluding all but ſuch both from happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and exemption from ſuch a curſe, contrary to the Analogy of Faith, and whole current of Scriptures; for what by ſuch Doctrine will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of all the Saints from <hi>Abel</hi> to this time, that were not Martyrs under Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe this will hold out an abſurdity of a two-fold Reſurrection (a thouſand years di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant each from other) of bodies, contrary to <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>The hour is coming, in which all that are in the Graves, ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done Good to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Life; and they that have done Evil, to the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> The ſtate of the Reſurrection being there held forth by Chriſt to be general and univerſal, relating to Good and Bad, and to be at one time, the hour. So in <hi>John</hi> 6. four ſeveral times he refers the Saints Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the laſt day, <hi>verſe</hi> 39.40, 44, 54. The profeſſed Faith of the Saints in that day, <hi>John</hi> 11.24. <hi>And</hi> Martha <hi>ſaid unto him, I know that he ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the laſt day.</hi> So 1 Cor. 15.51, 52. <hi>Behold I ſhew you a miſtery; we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed in a Moment, in the twinkling of an Eye,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152899:33"/> at the laſt Trump; for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the Dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed,</hi> Joh 19.25, 26. <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth.</hi> 26. <hi>And though, after, my skin, Worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi> So Job 14.12. <hi>Man lyeth down and riſeth not till the Heavens be no more,</hi> &amp;c. By which two Scriptures in <hi>Job</hi> the laſt day and time of the laſt Trump is explained, and limited to Chriſts perſonal coming, and end of the world, or diſſolution of the Heavens and the Earth, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe this opinion holds out this to be the firſt bodily Reſurrection, contrary to what the Scripture ſpeaks of, nine going before it. As firſt, the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi>'s Son, 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 17.22. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, The Son of the <hi>Shunnamite,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.35. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> The man that was raiſed by the touch of the Prophets Coffin. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.21. 4<hi rend="sup">y</hi> The Widow of <hi>Naim</hi>'s Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.15. 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> The Daughter of <hi>Jairus, Luke</hi> 8.55. 6<hi rend="sup">y</hi> 
                     <hi>Lazarus, John</hi> 11.44. 7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Thoſe many that came out of their Graves accompanying Chriſt at his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. 8<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                     <hi>Tabitha, Acts</hi> 9.41. 9<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                     <hi>Eutichus, Acts</hi> 20.16. By which ſeveral inſtances it muſt appear, thar either this is not a Corporeal Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſpoken of, or theſe nine mentioned were not ſo; for this cannot be ſaid in truth to be the firſt Corporeal Reſurrection, when nine went before it, but the Tenth Reſurrection rather.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:152899:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Bodily Reſurrection cannot be here meant, becauſe that is not to be till a thouſand years after this, as in this Chapter, when all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt give up their Dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, This cannot be the Corporeal Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ection of the Saints; for that cannot be till Chriſts perſonal coming and appearing, and day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Them which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.23. <hi>Christ the first fruits, afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1. <hi>Who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> And (as before) Chriſts perſonal coming is proved by many arguments not to be till after the thouſand years: And 'tis as clear that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day is not till after the thouſand years, and deſtruction of the <hi>Gog Magog</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, This cannot be the Corporeal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Saints, becauſe it inverts Chriſts order, which is to be at the ſounding of the laſt trumpet. The time of the living Saints change, the time that is expres'd to be the laſt day, which is the time of his coming and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the Judgment day. But this a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before all.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Becauſe if Corporeal and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Martyrs only, then all the dead at the laſt day ſhall be raiſed to the ſecond death; contrary to <hi>John</hi> 5.24.6.39, 40.44 54. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. And they only as Martyrs, Prieſts to God, contrary to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5, 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:152899:34"/>
                  <p>Ninthly, Becauſe if this be underſtood to be the Reſurrection of all the Saints, who in that immortal and glorified ſtate are to live and Reign the thouſand years in and over the world, it neceſſarily infers theſe ſtrange abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; that glorified and unglorified, mortal and immortal bodies muſt converſe together; for it neceſſarily follows, if the Saints are raiſed, then is Chriſt come in Glory, and their vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are made like to his glorified body; and that Chriſt and the Saints and Angels in this glorified ſtate converſe with the men of the world, Ruling, Governing and Ordering them in the reſpective policies by <hi>Zions</hi> Laws and Edicts, contrary to expreſs Scripture, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light, which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee,</hi> viz. No mortal man, no unglorified man; for if <hi>Moſes</hi> that had only a glimps of Gods back parts, had ſuch a Glory upon him, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not converſe with him without a vail; And the Diſciples were not able to ſtand before Chriſt in the Transfiguration, nor <hi>Paul</hi> in the Viſion; how unable will wicked men be to ſtand before, and converſe with Chriſt, who appears in tranſcendent Glory, both in his own and the Fathers Glory, the Glory of all the Holy Angels, and Glory of all Saints, as hereafter: And it is expreſly ſaid, that none can ſee God and live, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20. It being impoſſible that any poor, mortal, finite Creature can ſee and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:152899:35"/> ſtand before the glorious, immortal and infinite Being, without being conſumed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It holds out that ſome glorified and unglorified Saints, ſhall at this time converſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are raiſed from the dead, with thoſe that are then upon the Earth, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51, 52. that at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, that the dead Saints are raiſed, the living Saints, are changed at a Moment, in the Twinkling of an Eye, which muſt needs be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe when Chriſt comes, he muſt have all the Saints come with him, who are raiſed, changed and glorified, taken up in the Air to meet him, and in that ſtate are ever with him; not one Saint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be left behind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe he then appears in flaming fire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaint them that know him not, nor obey his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the day of Grace being then over, and none to be converted after that: And therefore are all the exhortations of making ready, of getting Oyl in the Veſſel and in the Lamp, before he comes, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too late to do it after he cometh.</p>
                  <p>A third abſurdity is, that whereas Chriſt ſaith, The laſt Enemy is Death, here the raiſed Saints af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death are to meet with another Enemy, the <hi>Gog-Magog</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, This cannot be the Corporeal Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection becauſe it is ſaid expreſlly, that during this thouſand years, the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> new Heaven and new Earth-ſtate, the Saints ſhall build, plant, Marry &amp; give in Marriage, enjoy the works of their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152899:35"/> hands, diſpenſe Laws, manage Governments in the world, and be lyable to death and deſſolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is utterly inconſiſtent with the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-ſtate, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.34. <hi>The Children of this world marry and are given in marriage.</hi> 35. <hi>But they which ſhall be accounted worthy to'btain that world, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage, neither can they dye any more,; for they are equal to the Angels, and are the childeren of God, being the Children of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the diſpenſing of Laws, managing worldly policies and affairs, being as utterly inconſiſtent with this ſtate alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither can this living or riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain intend the Spiritual Reſurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> the riſing from the death of ſin to the life of Grace, the converted, changed ſtate, though that will abundantly be manifeſted herein, both amongſt Jews and Gentiles by the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is ſuppoſed it ſpeaks of the Church that were converted &amp; lived a ſpiritual life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither was this a life their Enemies could take from them; for in this ſenſe they lived all the time of the Beaſts and the Dragons rage and rule, and in this reſpect might be ſaid to live moſt, when moſt lyable to outward death and diſtreſſes,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly neither can this be the Eternal Life of Glory, Becauſe this ſpeaks of a ſtate, that precedes that a thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>Therefore laſtly it will follow, that if it be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152899:36"/> the Corporeal, Spiritual nor Eternal Life, that is here meant, to which the Saints are raiſed, then muſt it be the miſtical or civil life, to which the Prophets give witneſs, as before: And the rather ſo, becauſe of that miſtical and civil death, that all Saints are lyable to, and lye under, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Antichriſts reign, becauſe they refuſe to worſhip the Beaſt or his Image, or receive his Mark and Number, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As alſo bcauſe the whole Church and all Saints do at this time par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this life; becauſe it is ſaid in the next verſe, that the reſt or others lived not, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that did worſhip the Beaſt, the Character of the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, they lived not this thouſand years, <hi>viz.</hi> this miſtical life: But are now to take their turns in the Vally of the ſhadow of death, lyable now to the Priſon-ſtate, and Gibbet. to give an account for all their cruelties and murders, to be kill'd all the day long, to be fill'd in the Cup they have fill'd, and as being thruſt in the pit and bound, kept from all Rule, Dignity and Authority,</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But why muſt the Church be included under theſe terms or characters of Souls beheaded, and that would not worſhip the Beaſt?</hi>
                  </p>

Some ſuppoſe a Corporeal death that is here intended; intimating that whilſt the Saints and Martyrs are raiſed, to live and Reign with Chriſt, the bodies of the wicked ſhall not be raiſed, but are to lye in their Graves, all the thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>And others ſuppoſe it a ſpiritual death, a death in ſin, an unconverted, unregenerated ſtate, that the wicked will be found in during all the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.</p>
                  <p>But it is humbly conceived there is the ſame good ground t'underſtand this as the former living of the Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> in a metaphorical ſenſe: As that living of the Saints is to be taken to be a civil life;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152899:37"/> ſo this death of the wicked is to be underſtood a civil death, being the direct Antitheſis to the former, and ſo indeed no other then a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and illuſtration of that happy ſtate of the Saints; for as when the Beaſt and Dragon and their worſhipers lived, <hi>viz.</hi> were found in the full exerciſe of power, Rule and Authority in the world, the Saints then civilly dyed, being not only put out of all capacity of that kind, but made lyable to all manner of natural deaths and diſtreſs for oppoſing their uſurpations, and refuſing their Idolatrous worſhip; ſo when the Saints come to take their turns to live in power and authority, then ſhall all the Beaſts and Dragons worſhipers and followers, take their turns in a ſtate of death too, not only thruſt from all Rule and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rendred lyable to give an account with their lives and liberties for all their cruelties and murders, during their tyrannous uſurpations: When they muſt have retaliation, and be filled in the Cup, they have filled to others, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded as they have rewarded the Saints, during their reign and rage. For how much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſoorrw ſhe muſt have.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But why called the reſt of the Dead that lived not again?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo is a proper Character of the falſe Church, holding out their preſent poſture and

                  </p>
                  <p>But why the Reſt of the Dead, ſo read, as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> after the manner of the Greek, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for the Nomnative, the reſt of the dead for the reſt being dead: ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20. reſt of the men, that is, other men.

The Saints that were dead, that would not worſhip formerly in the Dragons and Beaſts life and reign are now alive: But the other men that worſhiped Beaſt and Dragon, enter now a ſtate of Death and Judgment, who are judged to death all the thouſand years, no more to Rule or Reign either in Civils, Militaries, or Eccleſiaſticks (for, or under the Beaſt) during that time, then they permited the Saints to exerciſe any ſuch So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty for, and in the behalf of Chriſt, during their day; for as one goes up, the other goes down. They are not to live again till the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years be finiſhed, implying that when the Dragon is looſed, there will then be a Military power and juriſdiction at leaſt, that they may live to, again in oppoſition unto Chriſt and the Saints, in their encompaſſing the Camp of the Saints, and beloved City, which their ſaid raiſed ſtate makes good, and confirms the former interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152899:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> that their death is miſtically and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively to be underſtood of a civil, and not litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a Corporeal death; for if the dead men muſt not live again till the thouſand years be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and then muſt be raiſed out of their Graves, and in that Reſurrection-ſtate appear in that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary poſture, is ſuch an abſurdity, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume none will own: Wicked men being not raiſed to make oppoſition againſt Chriſt and his Saints, but to appear to judgment, being the Reſurrection (to them) of Damnation, as to the raiſed Saints of Life and Salvation.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But why then ſhould not we ſo take it, as the Scripture repreſents it, and ſo plainly lays it down? will you be wiſer than what is written? why ſhould we not ſo receive and believe it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt it muſt be taken for granted, that as the Beaſts Kingdom is a miſtery, ſo is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt no leſs; and threfore is the mind of wiſdom called for, to reach into the one as the other. And as the Apoſtle (2 Pet. 3.16.) <hi>ſpeaking of theſe things, in which</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>there are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt unto their own deſtruction;</hi> Which therefore calls for great ſear, caution and circumſpection in our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing about theſe great myſteries.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It muſt be taken for granted, that in the ſpeaking to theſe things no ſenſe ought to be given, that denyes received fundimental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152899:48"/> nor thwarts the Analogy of Faith, nor croſſes the current of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That it is the genuine ſenſe, true ſcope and intent of the Scripture, comparing Scripture with Scripture, and ſpiritual things with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and not only the litteral reading in ſome places; for otherwiſe the <hi>Racovian Catechiſme,</hi> aſſerting Socinianiſme ſhall go for good pay. Nay what Hereſie upon that account may not be aſſerted and proved? And therefore <hi>Maton</hi> well ſaith, whatſoever Text of Scripture is expounded any other ways than god meant by it, it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its interpretation, the word of man and not of God, and conſequently in adhearing to ſuch interpretations we believe not what God ſaith, but what man doth make him ſay.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, That we cannot receive theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the ſenſe that many give of them, that thus ſeem to aſſert Chriſt perſonally to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, either in the ſmiting or peaceable part of his Kingdom, during theſe thouſand years.</p>
                     <p>Take theſe following Reaſons, and weigh them in the fear of the Lord, in the true ballance of the Sanctuary, wherein we ſhall firſt ſhew, why they cannot ſo be received</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In what ſenſe truly according to the mind of Chriſt, they may and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That Chriſt Jeſus cannot properly be ſaid to be perſonally preſent in the ſmiting part, beſides the five Reaſons to this thing, <hi>Page</hi>

                        <hi>Becauſe it is expreſly ſaid, Pſal.</hi> 110.2. The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand, until I make thine Enemy thy foot-ſtool. <hi>compared with,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. But this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins for ever, ſat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting, till his Enemies be made his foot-ſtool. <hi>And therefore being as an overcomer, he ſat down with God upon his Throne, and the Earth his foot-ſtool: He is upon that Throne to reign, till all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be brought down, as</hi> 1 Cor. 15.25, 26. For he muſt Reign till he hath put all Enemies under his feet, the laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is death.</p>
                     <p>So that it is moſt manifeſt by this poſitive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that Jeſus Chriſt is to ſit upon the Throne of Heaven at Gods right hand, till all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be ſubdued; yea till death it ſelf as the laſt Enemy be conquered, which will not be till the general Reſurrection, when it ſhall be ſaid, that death is ſwallowed up in Victory, and Death and Hell ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire Therefore by this received principle, Chriſt ſhall not leave the Fathers right hand perſonally to encounter Dragon, Beaſt and Falſe-prophet, who are to be fought with (as is already proved) and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed before the general Reſurrection; Nay before the thouſand years, at the beginning whereof, many ſuppoſe is this perſonal coming and Reſurrection of the Saints: So that according
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152899:49"/> to their apprehenſions that ſeeming coming of Chriſt to war with the Saints againſt the Beaſt, Dragon, and Falſe-prophet, muſt admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſenſe, which is alſo expreſſed, <hi>Page</hi> 27, 28.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Neither can be properly be ſaid to be perſonally preſent in the peaceable part, or mountain ſtate, during the thouſand years.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe beſides the conſtant concurrence of Scripture, the univerſal conſent of all parties is, that Chriſt comes not perſonally till the bodily Reſurrection, and that there is no bodily Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either of Saints or ſinners in the beginning of the thouſand years. Take theſe Eleven Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Page</hi> 40. to 44.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It appears from the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his being at the Fathers right hand, till the general reſurrection, till Death the laſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be deſtroyed; and if ſo then the thouſand years is to be firſt over, and the Battle of <hi>Gog,</hi> before the general Reſurrection ſhall take place, and that this is true Doctrine, appears alſo from all the conſiderable places that make mention of his perſonal coming and appearing, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, From thoſe Scriptures that aſſert, that when he comes all the Saints ſhall come with him, which cannot be ſhort of the great Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                        <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28, 29.

And they ſhall come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit down in the Kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. For if we believe that Jeſus died and roſe again; even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him. 16 For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the Trumpet of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt. 17. Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51, 52. Behold I ſhew you a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed in a Moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt Trump (for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed.) 54. So when this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written; Death is ſwallowed up in Victory. 55. O Death <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>By which Scriptures it infallibly appears, that at
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152899:50"/> the coming of Chriſt all the Saints ſhall come with him: The living Saints are to be changed and glorified; The dead Saints to be raiſed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But if this coming of Chriſt, and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be to be underſtood at the beginning of the thouſand years, then cannot all the Saints come with him: For as page 37, multitudes both of Jews and Gentiles are to be called and converted in the thouſand years; Therefore cannot it be ſhort of the general Reſurrection after the thouſand years.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>We read Hebr.</hi> 9.7. That the High Prieſt alone once every year, not without blood, did enter into the Holy place to offer for himſelf, and the errours of the people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But (<hi>Verſe</hi> 11) Chriſt being come, an High Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 12. Neither by the blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us. 15. And for this cauſe he is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152899:52"/> the Mediator of the New Teſtament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 24. For Chriſt is not entered into the Holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into Heaven it ſelf now to appear in the preſence of God for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15. And there, as our High-prieſt is he touched with the feeling of our infirmities, being in a l points he was tempted like as we are, yet without ſin. To encourage us to hold faſt our profeſſion, and to come boldly to the Throne of Grace, to obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time of our need; who can have compaſſion on the ignorant, and them that are out of the way <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. For if any ſin, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who is the propitiation for our ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. Who was in all things made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people; For in that he himſelf ſuffered being tempted, he is alſo able to ſuccour them that are tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. And an High-prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedeck, Heb.</hi> 5.6. Who ever lives to make interceſſion for us, and to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.25. And this man, becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſt-hood; Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For ſuch an High-prieſt became us, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 7.24, 25, 26. So that whileſt ſinners are to be converted,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152899:53"/> Saints are liable to ſin, ſuffering, and temptation, and have need to pray, and be found in the uſe of Ordinances. Yea, whilſt they have any thing to do with God, ſhort of eternal Glory, they will ſtand in need of an Advocate, Mediatour, an Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, a Days-man. But this is needful to the end of the World, in and after the thouſand years; Therefore there is a neceſſity for the continuance of Chriſt's Mediation at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whilſt Sin, Satan, evil World, and Death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and till the Saints be ſafely entered into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reſt. Neither can he any more come off from that work, till he hath completed it; then the High-prieſt was to come off from within the Vail, till he had perfected the work, for which he entered the Holy Place. Therefore it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous to hold out any Doctrine, that may entrench upon this great office of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
                     <p>Again, neither can Chriſt perſonally appear with all the raiſed and glorified Saints in the thouſand years Reign, from the conſideration of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial work, that is to be tranſacted therein, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unſuitable for Glorified, Angelical, Spiritual Bodies; <hi>viz.</hi> To fight and wage War with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Swords, To diſpenſe Laws, to manage hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policies in the adminiſtration of Judgement, and Juſtice amongſt men, as well in the execution of Juſtice upon Tranſgreſſours, as to encourage the Well-doers to build, to plant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ſhare of worldly peace and plenty: To Preach the Goſpel,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152899:53"/> diſpenſe and partake of Ordinances: or to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the great Spiritual bleſſing in the pouring out of the Spirit; proper onely for natural bodies and humane capacities; and how incongruous it is for mortal and immortal, glorified and unglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Heavenly and Earthly bodies, to converſe and tranſact together; is already manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>Upon which conſiderations we cannot ſuppoſe, that Chriſt can perſonally be preſent in either part of the Kingdom, neceſſitating therefore ſome other ſenſe to thoſe former Scriptures, ſeeming to hold out the ſame, more agreeable to Truth and current of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay, in what ſenſe can you ſuppoſe Chriſt to be ſaid to come, to be with his people to fight againſt enemies, to Reign and ſit upon a Throne, if not perſonally?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the firſt, concerning Chriſts coming, it is neceſſary that we ſhould take notice of a fourfold coming of Chriſt in the Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> A Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, a Spiritual, a Myſtical, and a providential coming, each of which may alſo be uſed in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He is ſaid to come in perſon, when he came in the fleſh to take our Nature upon him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.2. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and alſo when he comes the ſecond time without ſin to Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.28. <hi>Acts</hi> 11 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.23. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, His ſpiritual coming is, either when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152899:54"/> he comes by his ſpirit to convince, call and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a Soul, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.20. or to confirm, ſeal, and eſtabliſh by his Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 14 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is miſtically conſidered either in his coming in the type, in the ſhadowy and legal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. or in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Antetype, or Goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He cometh in his Providence, either to redeem, deliver and ſave his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Lam.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.37. or to execute Vengeance in the deſtruction of his Enemies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>And it is the mind of wiſdom that muſt rightly and duly apply each of theſe according to the ſcope, drift and meaning of the holy ſpirit, and not miſtake the one for the other.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What are we to underſtand by Chriſts being with a people, or a people with Chriſt? can that be otherwiſe than perſonal? for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, <hi>They Reigned with Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt may be ſaid to be with a perſon or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he is ſo virtually by his ſpirit or ſpiritual preſence, or when he is ſo by his Word, Rule, Law or Precept.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Judah</hi> was ſaid to rule with God, (<hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.12.) when they cleaved to Gods Word and Rule.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> rejected the Government by Judges (which was Gods Ordinance and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment) for a King after the manner of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152899:54"/> Nations, they were ſaid to reject God from being their King, who vertually went in and out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and ſought their Battles for them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And therefore ſaid Jer.</hi> 8.19. Is not the Lord in <hi>Zion?</hi> Is not her King in her? why have they provoked me to anger with the graven Images?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſaid to ſit upon the Throne of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> in his charge to his Judges (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6. bids them take heed what they did; for you judg not for man, but for the Lord, who (he told them) was with them in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; being called forth as <hi>verſe</hi> 8. for the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, and for controverſies.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is ſaid therefore virtually and ſpiritually to dwell, to reſt, to walk amongſt his people, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. and they with him, to live with them and they with him, to ſuffer with them and they with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.15: <hi>Acts</hi> 7.9. To dye, be buried, quickned, raiſed with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. To work with him, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.6.1. Sup with him and he with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. To war and fight together with him and he with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> 5. To be Captain of the Hoſt and General of the Army, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. When all is but virtually and ſpiritually ſo.</p>
                     <p>So Satan is ſaid to be with his Servants &amp; Subjects acting and inſtructing, when he is not perſonally
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:152899:55"/> nor viſibly ſo. Satan ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. Where Satan dwelt, and Satans Seat and Throne was, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. When he was only ſo by his ſubſtitutes in his Authority, not really and perſonally, but virtually and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically.</p>
                     <p>And ſo to Reign and Rule, as God King'd it in <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his Word, Law and Authority, by his influence and ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>As the Dragons Rule is called the Devils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Devil influences, acts and ſpirits his principal Agents and Inſtruments, though not perſonally preſent.</p>
                     <p>So may the Rule in the hands of the Saints, be called Chriſts Kingdom or Soveraignty, though he be only virtually not perſonally preſent.</p>
                     <p>It is no new thing ſo to take it in his miſtical Kingdom in the Church, where his Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Ordinances are diſpenſed in his name, and by vertue of his ſpirit: It was no new thing to have it ſo eſteemed in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Typical Kingdom, when the Law was his, the Rulers by his choice and ſpiriting, the policy his, called therefore his Rule, Government, Soveraignty, Throne, Kingdom. And why then ſhould it be thought ſtrange in the Antetype.</p>
                     <p>When his Law, Rule, Policy, and Rulers called according to his qualifications, and influenced by his ſpirit, ſhall according to promiſe and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie come forth again in the world, why may they not as well be ſaid to Reign with Chriſt,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152899:55"/> as ſuffer with him. If we ſuffer with him we ſhall Reign with him. We do not think it any abſurdity to ſay, The King of <hi>Spain</hi> fights and Conquers in <hi>America,</hi> and Rules and Reigns there, though never perſonally preſent in that other world, but only vertually ſo, by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, by his Laws Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, that he hath transferred thither; by his Officers and Vice Roys, that he hath appointed in his name to Rule and Govern there. Did not the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate of old Govern the world at <hi>Rome</hi> by their Laws, and Edicts, and Rulers of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that they Commiſſioned and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>But by this Reaſon you ſeem to exempt Chriſts perſon from any ſhare of Rule or Soveraignty in any Kingdom here; whereas it is expreſly ſaid, He is to judge the quick and the dead at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and Kingdom, by which it is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that at his appearing he hath a Kingdom, and you owning that appearing to be perſonal, what do you make that Kingdom to be? And what ſhare hath Chriſts perſon in it.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer whereto I conceive it neceſſary in the firſt place, to give you the diſtinction of a five-fold Kingdom, the Scripture takes notice of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> a Providential, Spiritual, Monarchical miſtical, or Davidical and Miſphatical Kingdom: and then I ſhall give you my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and conceptions of this Kingdom hinted at, that he is to have at that his appearing: And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152899:56"/> for a want of a right diſtinguiſhing herein, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceds (as I humbly apprehend, all the miſtaken notions and differences about the Kingdom of Chriſt treated of in theſe papers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Therefore underſtand there is a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Kingdom which Chriſt hath, and doth (as God) manage over all the world, and that from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A ſpiritual Kingdom, which he doth and hath all along managed in the hearts of his people, from the beginning of the world to this day.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a miſtical Kingdom, or a Rule and Soveraignty, that he, as Lord and King, hath exerciſed in the Church, as well under the Law, as under the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is his Monarchical or Davidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Kingdom, namely, that dignity and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is in time according to promiſe, and propheſie to take place in and over the Nations, and to be managed by his Laws and Government, by his ſpirit and vertual preſence in his Servants and Subſtitutes: Which hath been the ſpecial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, There is that glorious Miſphatical Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> Soveraignty, that Chriſt Jeſus in perſon (with all the Saints in their glorified bodies with him) ſhall upon their general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Judgment, exerciſe here upon the Earth, before all is given up into the Fathers hands, which is further cleared to you in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152899:56"/> parts of it in the Scriptures following.</p>
                     <p>

For we have not followed cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deviſed Fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but were eye Witneſſes of his Majeſty, <hi>viz. They had a viſion of that power and glory that Chriſts Majeſty ſhall have, when he come in his Kingdom.</hi>

                        <hi>Luke</hi> 13.28. There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when you ſhall ſee <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out. 29.

And though after my skin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.

                     <p>ANd I ſaw a new Heaven, and a new Earth: for the firſt Heaven and the firſt Earth were paſſed away, and there was no more Sea.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 And I <hi>John</hi> ſaw the holy City, new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> coming down from God out of Heaven, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Bride adorned for her Husband.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And I heard a great Voice out of Heaven, ſaying, Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for the former things are paſſed away.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And he that ſat upon the Throne ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I make all things new. And he ſaid unto me, Write: for theſe words are true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And he ſaid unto me, Is it done: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, I will give unto him that is a thirſt, of the Fountain of the water of life freely.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he ſhall be my ſon.</p>

                     <p n="9">9 And there came unto me one of the ſeven Angels which had the ſeven Viols full of the ſeven laſt plagues, and talked with me, ſaying, Come hither, I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lambs wife.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 And he carried me away in the ſpirit to a great and high Mountain, and ſhewed me that great City, the holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſcending out of Heaven from God,</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a ſtone moſt precious, even like a jaſper ſtone, clear as Cryſtal;</p>
                     <p n="12">12 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve Angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve Tribes of the Children of Iſrael.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 On the Eaſt three gates, on the North three gates, on the South three gates, and on the Weſt three gates.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 And the wall of the City had twelve foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and in them the names of the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Lamb.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 And he that talked with me, had a golden Reed to meaſure the City, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 And the City lieth four ſquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he meaſured
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152899:68"/> the City with the Reed, twelve thouſand furlongs: the length, and the breadth, and the height of it are equal.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 And he meaſured the wall thereof, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fourty and four cubits, according to the meaſure of a man, that is, of the Angel.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 And the building of the wall of it was of Jaſper, and the City was pure gold, like unto clear glaſs.</p>
                     <p n="19">19 And the foundations of the wall of the City were garniſhed with all manner of precious ſtones. The firſt foundation was Jaſper, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Saphire, the third a Chalcedonie, the fourth an Emerald,</p>
                     <p n="20">20 The fifth Sardonyx, the ſixth Sardius, the ſeventh Chryſolite, the eighth Beryl, the ninth a Topaz, the tenth a Chryſopraſus, the eleventh a Jacinct, the twelfth an Amethyſt.</p>
                     <p n="21">21 And the twelve gates were twelve Pearls, every ſeveral gate was of one Pearl, and the ſtreet of the City was pure gold, as it were tranſparent glaſſe.</p>
                     <p n="22">22 And I ſaw no Temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it.</p>
                     <p n="23">23 And the City had no need of the Sun, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Moon to ſhine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</p>
                     <p n="24">24 And the Nations of them which are ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of it: and the Kings of the

                     <p n="25">25 And the gates of it ſhall not be ſhut at all by day, for there ſhall be no night there.</p>
                     <p n="26">26 And they ſhall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.</p>
                     <p n="27">27 And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, but they which are written in the Lambs Book of life.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The City of God, or Kingdom of Chriſt in the thouſand Years Reign further aſſerted, from the 21th, and part of the 22th. of the Revelations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis portion of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> the 21. <hi>Chap.</hi> to the 6. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 22 doth very elegantly hold forth the happy and Glorious condition of the Church in the thouſand years upon her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from her Enemies (by their juſt ruine and deſtruction) wherein the Angel gives <hi>John</hi> a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fuller diſcovery of that bleſſed ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof he had given him ſome hints and glimpſes in the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſo that what he called an enthroning, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. and a City ſtate, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. he here declares to be no leſs than a new World, a new Heaven and a new Earth; <hi>Babylons</hi> old World, her old Heavens and Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> Sun, Moon, Stars, Sea being burnt up and conſumed; and no other than the taking place of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> that holy and beloved City, after the ruine and deſtruction of that filthy and bloody City, or the coming forth of the Spouſe the Lambs wife in all her beatiful array (prepared for her Husband) after the deſolation, ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that beaſtly filthy Strumpet, that gaudy painted Harlot.</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:152899:70"/>
               <p>For you will find it naturally linkt to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſtory of the thouſand Years, and belonging to the State of Grace before the Judgement, and not becauſe it is put down after the Viſion of the Judgement, therefore it muſt ſo in order be reckoned, and then conſequently to belong to the State of Glory, as moſt Interpreters judge. For you will find nothing more frequent in this Book, then to give brief hints of things in one Chapter, and then to proſecute them more fully in the next, ſeveral occurrences of after dates intervening and coming betwixt: As for inſtance that paſſage in the eleventh Chapter, where he mentions firſt the ſlaughter of the witneſſes by the Beaſt, then of the Witneſſes, Reſurrection, enemies Deſtruction, and Chriſt's Kingdom, yet afterwards in the 13th. Chapter returns again to the Beaſt, and gives an account of his riſe and rage, which muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſuppoſed to be a Beaſt riſing up; after Chriſt's Kingdom takes place, (becauſe it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned after it) but a further and larger account of that Beaſt, that he had but briefly hinted at before in the eleventh Chapter.</p>
               <p>And that we are not miſtaken herein, Let firſt the Prophet himſelf, from whom the Prophecy is fetcht, about theſe new Heavens, and new Earth, and new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (which are both one) be the Judge. For you will find the time, when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells ſuch a ſtate to take place, is not to be in a ſtate of immortality and glory, but in this World ſhort of the Reſurrection and Judgement, becauſe he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152899:70"/> ſaith in the 21, 22, 23. Verſes of that 65. <hi>Iſa.</hi> It muſt be in a time, when Building, Planting, and Procreating will be proper, which cannot poſſibly be in the State of Glory and Immortality, as our Saviour himſelf hath over ruled, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.34, 35.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let it be conſidered that this new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or beloved City was in the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, otherwiſe why ſhould it be ſaid upon the expiring thereof in the 9th. Verſe of the 20th. that the <hi>Gog-Magog</hi> Army encompaſſed the Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider that the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here the Spouſe, the Lambs wife only prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made ready for her Husband, and not (following the Allegory) yet in that full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fruition, which the ſtate of glory brings her to.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be conſidered that in this ſtate, God is ſaid to Tabernacle and dwell with Men, which diſcovers it to be a ſtate of grace here, and not in that ſtate when they ſhall always be with God in the ſtate of glory. And that we are not alone herein, you have Mr. <hi>Forbs</hi> upon the 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> delivering himſelf thus, <hi>viz. All the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God towards this City, being committed to the Lamb, the Mediatour beſpeaks it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in this World; becauſe in the World to come he gives up the Kingdom to God, that he may be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28.</p>
               <p>And further, That nothing is here ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fickly ſpoke, which the Prophets before have not
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:152899:71"/> almoſt in the ſame terms, uttered of the ſtate of the Church here in Grace; we will eaſily perceive that no ſuch thing is here meant as whereto moſt part of interpreters have drawn it. But even by this amaſſing together of all the goodly promiſes in the Prophets, of the Churches graceful and peaceable ſtate to let us ſee, that all this time ſhall be the full performance, never any more to be diſturbed and ſo therein the Myſtery of God to be finiſhed, nothing now reſting to be either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or wiſhed, but that the Lord Jeſus come quickly.</p>
               <p>And the Aſſembly in their Annotations upon <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. <hi>viz.</hi> As the Church is altered, ſo muſt her dwelling; it may be ſpoken of a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Church on Earih, and then the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſet before it in the former <hi>Chap.</hi> That the downfall of the Enemies of Gods Church, might be ſet down altogether, and then the Churches felicity after the deſtruction of the Whore, Beaſt, Dragon, and all covert and open Enemies, which new ſtate will abide till Glory come. Bringing in of Eaſtern Kingdoms may well be called a new world.</p>
               <p>And Mr <hi>Mede</hi> further very ſignificantly to this point upon his ſixth Synchronyſme in his <hi>Clavis Apoc. p.</hi> 24. gives the following four ſubſtantial Arguments to enforce the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The Marriage of the Lamb and that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Kingdom of the Almighty Lord God, both

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ylon,</hi> where the ſeventh Trumpet beginneth; this appeareth out of the Hymn of the Elders and Beaſts; which in the former Synchroniſme we have commended out of the Nineteenth <hi>Chapter, verſe</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah; for our Lord God Almighty Reigneth: Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour to him; for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelf ready.</hi> Put the New <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> is that Bride of the Lamb, aborned and prepared for her Husband, <hi>Chapter</hi> 21. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. <hi>And I ſaw</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Holy City, new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem coming down from the God out of Heaven, as a Bride adorned for her Husband,</hi> and verſe 9. <hi>Come, and I will ſhew thee the Bride, the Lambs wife,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the beloved City, but that beloved City forthwith, after he thouſand years are ended, is ſaid to be compaſſed about by thoſe Troops of Satan then let looſe, <hi>Chapter</hi> 20. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>And they compaſſed the Tents of the Saints, and the beloved City,</hi> therefore it muſt needs have been extant before, while Satan was yet bound.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſeventh Vial being poured out, wherewith the Beaſt is diſpatcht and aboliſhed, there came a loud voice from the Throne, ſaying <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>A Wall is for ſafety, ſecurity, and defence, as well as for Ornament and Beauty.</p>

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:152899:85"/> of the Gates, twelve entire Pearls.</p>
                  <p>In all which (no queſtion) ſingular Myſteries are intended, which for want of light we may come very ſhort in the underſtanding of, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we have attained, you may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole take theſe following general hints, from whence light may be fetcht to look into the particulars, viz.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the exact menſuration of both Wall, Gates and City it ſelf in all their dimenſions.</p>
                  <p>We may underſtand that as of old both in the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.4. as in the Temple, firſt 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.19. and ſecond, Zach, 2.1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Ezek. 43.11, 12. all things relating to the worſhip and ſervice of God was to be exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Rule, even to the very Pins and Nails of the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So alſo in this Glorious ſtate of the Church, how large and extenſive ſoever, yet is ſhe not, it ſeems, in an arbitrary way to order and regulate her affairs, either relating to the worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, or to her whole Oeconomy of Rule and Government, but muſt in all lie truly level to the ſquare, and even to the pattern, of the Golden Reed of Gods Word, which muſt try both Members, Doctrine, Worſhip, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:152899:85"/>2. By this wonderful great and high Wall, that is ſaid thus to encompaſs this glorious City, we may conclude that the Protection, Salvation and defence of the Church ſhall be very ſingular, and that then that Word of the Prophet ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land, nor waſting and deſtruction within thy borders, but thou ſhalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy Gates Praiſe;</hi> And that when Gods en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſings and encampings ſhall be ſo viſibly without, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9 8. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.16, 17. And his co-habitation within, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3.22, 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.3. Then may the Church ſafely conclude that Song may ſeaſonably be Sung, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.1. <hi>We have a strong City, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will God appoint for Walls and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the matter of the Wall being of the ſame glorious ſubſtance that the Glory it ſelf and chief Corner Foundation-ſtone is of, viz. the precious Jaſper as clear as Chryſtal, denotes that the Churches Foundation, Glory and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is Jeſus Chriſt; for he is the Elect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Corner-ſtone, and other Foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt, who is alſo their Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:152899:86"/>4. That as the twelve Gates ſtanding upon the four quarters within <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Type were places through the Wall, that gave entrance into the City to the twelve Tribes, coming up out of all the World, to worſhip and to partake of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that belonged to the natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> as ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt; Our feet ſhall ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy gates O</hi> Jeruſalem: Jeruſalem <hi>is builded as a City compacted together, whither the Tribes go up; The Tribes of the Lord unto the Teſtimony of Iſrael to give thanks unto the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So here theſe twelve Gates ſerve for entrance in the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to all the Elect, who are the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (for they that are Chriſts, whether Jew or Gentile are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed according to promiſe) even thoſe, who are built upon the foundation o the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone: and ſo entering in by Chriſt the door, they have admiſſion by the Angels or Miniſters of Chriſt, into the rights and priviledges of this Holy free City, the Mother of us all, and are to be eſteemed as the true <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> the children of <hi>Sarah</hi> the free Woman, the marked ſealed number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the twelve Tribes Spiritual.

It would alſo have a ſad tendency to confirm the poor deluded Papiſts, who being intoxicated with the Whores Cup, and inchanted with her painted ſplendour and beauty, do (reſpecting only <hi>Moſes</hi> pattern) do place ſo much of their Religion and devotion, in outward ornament, and pomp, whoſe decking of Churches and beſpangling Prieſts, Veſtments and Alter cloathes, takes up ſo much of their Divine adoration, and reverence, as though gold and gain was grace and godlineſs, and as that which would recommend them to God in his worſhip and ſervice, though if that be grace the <hi>Magul, Tartarian,</hi> and <hi>Iapan</hi> Empires, exceed them far, and teſtifie much more grace in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſervice, then they in their pretended worſhip of Chriſt; their Prieſts, Temples, Altars and Idols, being more richly adorned with gold and precious ſtones, then thoſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Ogilbies Japan</hi> Hiſtorie informeth us: And which would alſo too much ſtrengthen them in that horrible and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:152899:90"/> deluſion; that the Popedom is the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, this glorious Kingdom of Chriſt upon the Earth, becauſe it is attended with ſo much outward pomp, luſter and glory, by ſo many Potentates bowing their knee thereto, and bringing ſo much of the glory and honour of the Nations unto it; and which is juſt as (true to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the other Metaphor) as that the vileſt and moſt impudent Strumpet in the world, ought to be eſteemed a modeſt and chaſte Virgin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="1">1.

And on the contrary, <hi>Smyrna</hi> was poor as to man, but rich as towards God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let it not be thought ſtrange that the riches here ſpoken of ſhould relate to Chriſt Jeſus, and his Saints and Members, and to hold forth his precious Doctrines, and the rich Graces of his Spirit; though conſidered in themſelves are infinitely of greater value than all the riches in the world, as <hi>Job</hi> 28.12. &amp;c. to the end of the Chapter. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72 <hi>Pro.</hi> 3, 15. the outward Glory of the old Teſtament, Houſe or Temple, chiefly Typing out the Spiritual Glory of the new Teſtament, Houſe, and Temple, which is made up of Chriſt, and his Members, and ſpeaks hereby; but the Language of the Prophet fulfilling, <hi>Iſa</hi> 54.11.</p>
                  <p>Now if <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> gets the Grace, the Spiritual Gold, the Pearl and precious Stones, which are the ſubſtance, the true and durable riches, the Jaſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like-Glory, Wall of Salvation and precious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſtone, which through the pouring out of the

                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>John</hi> hath a Viſion of the Lords ſitting <hi>upon this Throne, Rev.</hi> 4.2.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As that Throne was poſited in the midſt of the Camp, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Levites</hi> in their 24. Courſes being about it, and the whole Congregation divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into four Brigades, under four principal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, <hi>viz.

And <hi>Ephraim</hi> on the Weſt with a Bullock, being alſo

                  </p>
                  <p>So in this Book you have the Imperial Seſſion of God and of his Church, exactly framed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the form of that ancient Encamping of God with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, where you have the 24 Elders ſitting in 24 Thrones round about the Throne, clothed in white Raiment, and Crowns of gold upon their Head, in alluſion to the 24 Courſes of <hi>Levites,</hi> that incompaſt the other Throne; and the four living Creatures, viz. the <hi>Lyon</hi> the <hi>Calf,</hi> the <hi>Man,</hi> and the <hi>Eagle</hi> were in like manner round about the Throne, anſwering not onely the four Standards before mentioned, but <hi>Ezekiels</hi> four Cherubins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.10. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering as one obſerves the various conſtitutions, frames and tempers of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>All which both Elders and living Creatures thankfully acknowledge in their new Song, to have been <hi>Redeemed out of every Kindred, Tongue, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Nation, (beſpeaking them Saints) and that they are made unto God, Kings and Prieſts to Reign on the Earth, Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth they were the Churches Repreſentatives, and therefore are theſe Redeemed ones ſaid to <hi>ſtand before the Throne in white Robes, and Palmes
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:152899:102"/> in their hands, and to be a great multitude, that no man could number, Rev.</hi> 7.9.

As he Tabernacled of old with his People.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the Throne in the days of <hi>Solomon</hi> was put into the moſt Holy place, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was that Cubical ſquare of twenty Cubits every way. So was this Throne put into this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bical ſquare of 1500. Miles ſquare, as before in the Cubical figure, page 160.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That as there was pitcht by the Throne both in the Tabernacle and Temple, the golden Altar, the Candleſtick, and the Sea; ſo in alluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you have, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. ſeven Lamps of fire burning before the Throne, interpreted to be the ſeven Spirits of God, and the Sea of glaſs like Chryſtal, which in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. is called, <hi>the pure River of Water of Life clear as Cryſtal, proceeding out of the Throne; And alſo golden Vials,</hi> 5.8. <hi>And golden Cenſures, with much Incenſe before the golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4.

                  <p n="5">5. That as the unity of the Godhead and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt was manifeſtly held forth by Chriſt ſiting upon the Throne, who in all reſpects was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:152899:103"/> owned to be God, though ſometimes called an Angel.</p>
                  <p>So is the ſame great and bleſſed truth, fully in diverſe reſpects made out in this Book, reſpecting Chriſt's (the Lamb) ſitting upon the Throne with the Father, as appeareth by the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is called the Throne of God and the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. Thereby intimating that Chriſt Jeſus hath equal property and Intereſt therein, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it no robbery to be equal with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.</p>
                  <p>The unity of the Godhead being made out in the next words, <hi>and his Servants ſhall ſerve him, Rev.</hi> 22.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that ſat upon the Throne ſaid, <hi>I am Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, Rev.</hi> 21.5. Which is the ſame that is attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.11. As alſo to God himſelf, <hi>Verſe</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that ſat upon the Throne was to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like a Jaſper, the very ſame that is ſpoken of Chriſt; who is repreſented to be that Saphir like glory, that Wall of Saphir, and that foundation Saphir ſtone</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that ſat upon the Throne had Divine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration and worſhip given him by the Church or their Repreſentatives, the 24. Elders and four li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.10, 11. They alſo worſhip and adore the Lamb. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>The whole Church with joynt conſent, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:152899:103"/> one voice aſcribe the like ſalvation and glory to the Lamb, as they do to God ſitting upon the Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>And again, in the 11 and 12. <hi>Verſes,</hi> falling upon their Faces do worſhip God in unity, ſaying, <hi>Amen, Bleſſing, and Glory, and Wiſdom, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, and Honour, and Power, and might be unto our God, for ever and ever, Amen</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which alſo by the whole Church in that innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitude is given to the Lamb, 5.14. ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb, that was ſlain to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then every Creature in Heaven and Earth is heard, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſing, Honour, Glory and Power be unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the Church again Echoes by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> and falling down and worſhipping <hi>Him,</hi> (viz. the unity of the Godhead <hi>that liveth for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. You have alſo an evidence of this great truth, out of the Mouths of the enemies themſelves, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Babylon</hi> that is to be deſtroyed, <hi>Rev</hi> 6.15 16, 17. <hi>And the Kings of the Earth, and the great men and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men, and every Bond-man, and every Free-man,</hi> (compare Rev. 19.18) <hi>ſaid to the Mountains and Rocks, fall upon us and hide us from the Face of the him that ſits upon the Throne, and from the wrath

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. That as Chriſt, God, was King, Lord, and Law-giver of old unto his Church and People, ruling and governing them upon that Throne in all things reſpecting both Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, and Military affairs.</p>

                  <p>For the Text ſaith, when that Throne of the Lord and of the Lamb ſhall be in it, that his Servants ſhall ſerve him, <hi>viz</hi> his Saints and people ſhall be ſubſervient to him in this great miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of managing the Throne, viz. they are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to aſcend the Thrones and Judgements, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. <hi>And I ſaw Thrones, and they ſat upon them, and Judgemene was given unto them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

And therefore has the holy Spirit por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied the Beaſt, and where the Chief Rulers upon this Throne are to have <hi>their Garments all stained with Blood of a Crimſon and Scarlet Colour, and to be drunk with Blood, Blood within and Blood without, a Scarlet Whore riding upon a Crimſom Coloured Beaſt,</hi> and therefore is that cry under the Altar, <hi>How Long ere thou avenge our blood at her hand.</hi>

Is not, nor cannot be the ſame with his apprehending, caſting into, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up, and ſealing in the bottomleſs pit for a thouſand years by the Angel that comes from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which I prove from theſe four eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the point of time, when each caſting down was.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the difference of time, when theſe two caſtings down were, which may appear in the particulars following, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in the 12th. Chapter was before the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:152899:113"/> Beaſts riſe, that in the 20th. after his ruine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in the 12th. was before the 42 Months or 1260 days, and that in the 20th. after.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That in the 12th. was upon the treading un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Holy City, and that in the 20th. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the erecting, or reſtoring it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That in the 12th. takes place under the ſixth Seal, and that in the 20th. not till the ſeventh Trumpet, which is no leſs then 1260. years dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in time.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Dragons caſting to the Earth in the 12th was according to theſe forementioned characteriſtical notes, viz. before the Beaſts riſe, or 42. Moneths taking place, when the City was troden under foot, and in the time of the ſixth Seal, is fully owned and aſſerted. And that this binding was not till the Beaſts ruine, end of fourty Moneths, the reſtoring of the City, and the ſeventh Trumpets ſounding, I thus prove</p>
                  <p>If the Dragon was not bound, but free under the firſt ſix Trumpets of the ſeventh Seal, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines he muſt be bound under the ſeventh, and ſo conſequently at the end of the 42 Moneths, and Beaſts ruine and reſtoration of the City, which are all as contemporaneous as the other four. But that he was not bound under the firſt ſix Trumpets, I thus prove,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not under the ſix firſt Seals; for then he wore the imperial Crown upon his head, and ſo fought <hi>Michael</hi> under the ſixth Seal, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 3, 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As theſe two Actions differ in point of time, ſo alſo in point of place, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the 12th appears (upon the War in Heaven) to be a caſting down from thence, by <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels that ſubdued him: But this in the 20th ſeems to be a Scene acted in another place, <hi>viz</hi> not in Heaven, but by an Angel coming down from Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Earth where the Dragon was, and in the <hi>Armageddon</hi> rout apprehends him upon the Earth, and caſts him not out of Heaven to the Errth, as before, but out of the Earth (as it were under the Earth) into the bottomleſs pit.</p>
                  <p>The one being a caſting him out of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire he poſſeſſed in the Roman world, when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (as a type of the man-child that muſt

                  <p>The other a caſting him out of the Empire, he ſhall enjoy at the <hi>Armageddon</hi> Battle, which will comprehend no leſs than three whole parts of the world, yea all that the ten horned Crowned Beaſt poſſeſſeth not: the Dragons circuit then containing <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> whether <hi>Turk, Mogul,</hi> Emperours of <hi>Perſia, China, India, Preſter John,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> north or South, the Beaſt bearing way in the <hi>European</hi> Territories only; the whole Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rule being then called Dragon, in diſtinction from the Beaſt, or Antichriſtian powers, and yet both together doth but make up that fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, that extends it ſelf to the four parts of the world; for they in conjunction (as you find, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13, 14.) command and influence the whole world, which Chriſt is to vanquiſh in the fifth Monarcy, that the Kingdoms of this world may become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and the City of God be of as large an extent, as the City of the Nations, which <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Dominion heretofore was not; for he had no part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> but part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and not all <hi>Europe,</hi> and of far leſs extent is the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Territories, ſuppoſed to be the Dragon.</p>
                  <p>And ſo upon the Dragons ſecond foil, he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have place in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:152899:115"/> world or <hi>European</hi> Territories, the principal part thereof, that was poſſeſſed by the Beaſt, nor yet in the Earth, viz. in the heatheniſh Rule and Soveraignty, all which is to be in the hands of the Saints, during the thouſand years, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon as far from either as a perſon that is ſhut up, and fettered and chained in a Dungeon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From the different Actions and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relating to the one and the other, as expreſt in each Chapter; nothing related in the 20th appearing to be in the 12th, nor any thing in the 12th to be tranſacted in the 20th.</p>
                  <p>In the 20th there are four things related of the Dragon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he was apprehended by an Angel deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he was bound or chayned by the ſaid Angel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he was caſt into the Bottomleſs Pit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Shut up and ſealed therein for a Thouſand years, but none of theſe in the 12th Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Neither is that Fighting in Heaven, nor caſting down of the Dragon from Heaven to Earth, as expreſt in the 12th, once ſo much as named in the 20th, but the contrary as before.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From the different end of the Dragons dealing with, in one place and the other; Becauſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the Twelfth Chapter he is caſt out into the Earth (not there to be Bound) but to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down at his pleaſure, which further appears; Becauſe he was</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To torment, vex, diſturb and deceive the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:152899:116"/> Inhabitants of the Earth, and therefore is Wo pronounced to them, becauſe of that great wrath he comes down to them in <hi>verſe,</hi> 12</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To annoy the Church by perſecutions, ſtirring up of War, caſting Flouds out of his mouth againſt her, as being full of wrath againſt the woman, and the remnant of her feed that keep the Commandments of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus; Whereas in the 20th it is expreſly laid down as one eſſential reaſon of his binding and caſting into the Pit for a Thouſand years, <hi>That he ſhould deceive the Nations no more, till the Thouſand years were expired.</hi> And the Church was to be ſo far from annoyance and diſturbance by him, or any of his accomplices, that they are ſaid to ſit upon the Thrones in a Reigning, peaceable poſture, and all enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſubjection; which ſtate doth not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly admit of ſuch Satanical diſturbances.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being ſo, it then appears, that there is a manifeſt miſtake in that firſt Reaſon urged,</p>
                  <p>And that the <hi>Epocha,</hi> that is made of the Thouſand years in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. muſt not be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Conſtantines</hi> caſting down Heatheniſm in the downfall of the 10 horned Imperial Dragon, which was before the 42 months under the Sixt ſeal, during the treading under foot the holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before the riſe of the Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>But at the binding and reſtraint of thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Governments influenced by the Devil
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:152899:116"/> that ſhall be exerciſed all the World over, in diſtinction from the Beaſtly or Antichriſtian pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and at the end of the 42 months, the finiſhing of the Beaſts reign, the building of the City or new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the ſounding of the ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</p>
                  <p>But now in anſwer to that Objection; What Kingdom of Chriſt in the hands of his Saints could that be, that during the Thouſand years was ſo expoſed to the Dragons and Beaſts rage, wrath, fury, perſecution, ſo ſhut up in the Wilderneſs, ſo hunted, ſlaughtered and deſtroyed? It is ſaid in anſwer, that it is only an inviſible and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom that is there intended.</p>
                  <p>But that it cannot ſo be underſtood, let the Text it ſelf be the Judge, which Firſt aſſigns Reſurrection and Life to be the undoubted marks and characters of the Church of Chriſt in this their Reign, as death and not life to be the mark writ upon Antichriſts Church (the <hi>Antitheſis</hi>) For as durcng the Dragon and Antichriſts Reign, the true Church was in a ſtate of Death and Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>viz. Civil death. Rev.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>6. So now is the Falſe to take its turn in the valley of the ſhadow of Death, and to give an account with their lives and liberties for all the cruelty they have exerciſed to the members of Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>8.6, 19.2. Who are therefore during the Saints Reign ſaid not to live, viz. <hi>a Civil Life;</hi> The Life of the one being the Death of the other, which you'l find are not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:152899:117"/> only the plain words and true ſenſe of the place, but what is ſo agreeable to the parallel place. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.12, 13, 14. 15. For when the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes riſe and aſcend, then Wo and Deſtruction befalls their enemies, which can no wayes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a Spiritual and Inviſible Reſurrection and Life, without manifeſt injury to truth, and ſpoiling the very drift and ſcope of the holy Spirit in the Prophecy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have alſo in the Text, Thrones and Judgment aſſigned to this Reign, which are certain infallible Enſigns and Characters of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule and Authority, when as Judges they ſhall ſit upon Thrones, judging their enemies, who have in a judicial way judged them all the time of their Reign, and which by no means can be confin'd to Spiritual and Inviſible Thrones and Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Reign of the Saints is further held forth as a reward of their ſorrow and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and faithfull witneſs to Chriſt, under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts Reign, which was not Spiritual and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but open and manifeſt, as now their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward muſt be; Antichriſt being now turned off the ſtage, and they having ſuffered with, or for Chriſt, muſt now Reign with, or for him: As <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10.7.14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, From what already hath been ſaid from the Text, as to the end of the Dragons binding, that he might not deceive the Nations any more during the thouſand years, which is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152899:117"/> explained afterward to be a ſtirring them up to annoy and diſturb the Saints, which he doth after his releaſe to the encompaſſing the camp of the Saints and the beloved City; Which is a further fuller demonſtration of their viſible rule: For during the ſaid ſeaſon of a thouſand years, they are to enjoy abſolute peace and quiet; for Satan being bound by Chriſts chains and Laws, the Nations are preſerved from deceit, and the Saints thereby kept in tranquility, as the bleſſed effect of Viſible Rule and good Government.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the confining of an Inviſible ſpiritual Reign to the thouſand years, is in my judgment as inconſiderate, as inconſiſtent to the truth: for ſince there were any Saints in the World, it may be ſaid, they ſo Reigned, and ſo all ages both before and ſince might as well be eſteemed the Saints Reign, as that thouſand years; ſo that if the thouſand years be paſt, then is the Saints Inviſible ſpiritual Reign paſt alſo, which none upon ſecond thoughts will in any wiſe affirm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it is ſaid if it be not ſ iritual and inviſible, what will you make of <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10. It being there ſaid upon the Dragons caſting down, that now is come <hi>Salvation and ſtrength and the Kingdom of our God,</hi> and the power of his Chriſt, and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15, 16, 17. As contemperaneous therewith, It is ſaid that the ſealed ones are upon the Throne of God and ſerve him day and night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Lamb in the midſt of the Throne
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:152899:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> feeds them, compared alſo with a parallel place. <hi>Rev</hi> 5.9, 10. Wh re the new Song is ſung upon the opening of the Seals; <hi>Thou haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall Reign on the Earth.</hi> Now all this muſt either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to an inviſible Kingdom and Reign at this time, or viſible, but the latter it could not, becauſe of the Beaſts Reign that ſo immediately took place.</p>
                  <p>To which I reply, Firſt as to <hi>Rev</hi> 12.10 that that action of outing the Heathen Rulers with their Gods and Diabolicall worſhips, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning their Temples, executing Judgment upon thoſe, that ſo long murdered the Saints upon the account of Chriſtianity, and this too to bring into the ſupreme Government of the World, one that would manage it for and under Chriſt, and for the good of his Saints, was no doubt as ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious a change in the Romane World, as it was a manifeſt real type of what ſhould hereafter be, when the Manchild ſhould indeed take to himſelf his great power and Reign. And this no doubt was an actual putting forth of Chriſts viſible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Kingdom and Authority; For the quarrel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the Dragon, as the Text ſtateth it, was, whether the Dragon or Manchild ſhould rule the Nations; and the War accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly was in Heaven; not as ſome notion it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in and concerning the Religions then profeſſed in the World, viz. whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſhould be worſhiped; but who ought to have
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152899:118"/> the Government of the World, without which their Idol Gods, Temples, and Worſhip could not have been ſo abandoned, as thy were upon that wonderfull change. For by Heaven here where the War was and out of which the Dragon was caſt, and into which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> entred, was the Viſible Government and Authority that was exerciſed in the Romane World; as Mr, <hi>Mede</hi> very learnedly, and the Aſſemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies Annotations with Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> and others with great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration do illuſtrate, as is before demonſtrated, to which the Reader is referred. Though this muſt alſo be granted, that this viſible Authority thus gained on Chriſts behalf continued but a ſhort ſpace, and was after <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time eclipſed, as one well obſerves, ſaying, <hi>Thus it was at the beginning of this turn of things, this Reign and Kingdom ſoon clapt in again as the Sun in a Cloud, in respect to the outward splendour of it,</hi> as intimated. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.5.</p>
                  <p>And as to that urged from <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9, 10.15, 16, 17.5.9, 10. As belonging to this time, I conceive upon better conſideration it will be found to be a clear miſtake.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe they properly belong to the Seventh, not the Sixth Trumpet being the ſame Palm-bearing multitude, who are the Citizens of the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.4. <hi>with</hi> 7.6. where it is ſaid in both places; <hi>They ſhall hunger no more nor thirſt any more, and that the Lamb ſhall feed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152899:119"/> them, and lead them to the living Fountains of Water, and that God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are alſo the 144000 ſealed and marked ones mentioned to ſtand with the Lamb upon mount Zion ſinging the New ſong <hi>Chapter</hi> 14. which is no other then the New ſong mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. and ſo all belonging to one and the ſame time, viz Chriſts Reign, when they are made Kings and Prieſts upon the Earth, to the New <hi>Jeruſalem-ſtate</hi> and to the Sounding of the ſeventh Trumpet.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſaid, This Song was ſung upon the opening of the ſeals; It is true, it was ſo, and you'l find upon the opening of the ſeventh Seal, brings on the ſeven Trumpets and ſeven Vialls, and the ſeventh Trumpet and ſeventh Vial, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporize with the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or ſeven <hi>Mellennium,</hi> and ſo finiſheth the myſtery of God, and therefore properly applyed to them, but ſhort of them, can in no ſence be either pertinent or true.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond Objection, as to the order of the Prophecy, I think I need do little but return that Obſervation for the Solution, viz <hi>That for the order of things to be done, whereof the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation <hi>speaketh, we muſt ſearch that in the Seal-prophecy, which ends with the</hi> 11th <hi>Chapter; all that follows being only a more plentifull declaration of things hinted before, and ſo the order is not ſo much regarded in this latter prophecy, that</hi> (viz the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152899:119"/> Order) <hi>being to be fetcht out of the former.</hi> Which is true, For you will find in this latter Syſteme of Prophecies from the 11th <hi>Chapter</hi> that the former part of the 12th takes place before much of the 11th; and the former part of the 13th the latter part of the 12th: And good part of the 11th contemporizeth with (if not precedes) much of the 14th: The 18, 19 and 20th is an explanation of the 17th or rather all from the 11th <hi>Chapter</hi> to the end is but an enlargement and expoſition of what is epitomized in the 11th, where under the witneſſes prophecy, Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion is held forth the Beaſts riſe, rage and ruine and the taking place of Chriſts Kingdom which the mind of wiſdom (warily obſerving the parallel of Synchroniſms) muſt get the diſtinct knowledge into each, as laid down mixedly from the 11th to the end.</p>
                  <p>And that no ſuch order, as is ſuggeſted, is to be obſerved, nor any ſuch diſtance betwixt them as imagined; But that the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> beloved City, new Heaven and Earth or City of God is one with Chriſts Kingdom in the thouſand years, may appear from theſe following conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, viz.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe upon the deſtruction of the fourth Monarchy, viz. (the Whore and Beaſt or the Magiſterial and Miniſterial part of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt) the thouſand years Reign of Chriſt and the Saints begin; or the marriage of the Lamb,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:152899:120"/> or new Heavens-ſtate (being both one, as <hi>Rev,</hi> 19.7.21.2.) takes place; and therefore are the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> ſung by the Church for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Glory, Honour and Power, that Jeſus Chriſt takes to himſelf thereupon. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is fully manifeſt, that the beloved City is in being during the thouſand years: For upon the Dragons releaſe he ſtirs up the Nations againſt the City of God, and accordingly is the <hi>Gog-Magog</hi> deſign to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege and encompaſs it, which is no leſs in circuit than the whole Earth, being the <hi>Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> to great <hi>Babylon</hi> the City of the Nations: for as one goes down, the other goes up, in the beginning of the thouſand years, by which it is undenyable, that during the thouſand years the beloved City had a being, and for better ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction herein, you may ſee Mr <hi>Mede p.</hi> 24. upon his 6th <hi>Synchroniſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe of the <hi>Harmonious</hi> marks, and Characters, that accord with both in their taking place in the World, viz.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doth the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> enter, when the ſeventh Trumpet Soundeth and the Kingdoms of this World become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt? <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15, 18. So doth the thouſand years. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4, 6. comparde with 19.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Doth the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> take place upon the pouring out of the Vials, and finiſhing the

So upon the pouring out of the ſeventh Vial upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Beaſt, when the thouſand years begin, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.21, 22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1. It is alſo ſaid, It is done. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is one the beginning of Chriſts viſible Kingdom upon the Earth? ſo is the other. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4, 6.19 6.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. Is the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or City of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive over the whole Earth, as great <hi>Babylon</hi> the City of the Nations was? So is the Reign of Chriſt in the thouſand years. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9.</p>

                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:152899:121"/>
                  <p>The third <hi>Object.</hi> againſt the Harmony or one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe two ſtates is; becauſe of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that ſo poſitively in their apprehenſions aſſert Chriſts perſonal preſence in the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>-ſtate, ſo inconſiſtent with the 1000. years, after which is to be the <hi>Gog. Magog</hi> attempts. The Scriptures uſually mentioned are, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3.22.22.3. The Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and God himſelf ſhall be with them. The Throne of God and of the Lamb ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I would ſay in the firſt place, that if I have reaſoned right in anſwer to the former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection about the order, it neceſſarily and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably follows, that theſe Scriptures that ſpeak of Gods Tabernacling, and dwelling with men, and men beholding his face, muſt be underſtood of a vertual preſence and co-habitation, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and proper: which I think will be eaſily granted by them, eſpecially that acknowledge the thouſand years inconſiſtent with the perſonal preſence, the Analogy of Faith being to be kept in all our interpretations and expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, neither is there any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in theſe Scriptures, that neceſſitates literal underſtanding, ſo as to inforce a perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, much of the ſame being expreſt elſewhere relating to Goſpel days, of the vertual preſence, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. for ye are the Temple of the living God, as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:152899:122"/> them and walk in them, <hi>Rev</hi> 2.1. Chriſt is ſaid to walk in the golden Candleſticks or Churches, and the great priviledge of Saintſhip, is to hold Communion with God, to maintain fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to walk with him, to enjoy the light of his Countenance, and to ſee his face; The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures I need not quote being ſo well known.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the perſonal preſence cannot be in the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, as granted it cannot be in the thouſand years, I refer you to thoſe many Arguments, Reaſons and Scriptures given in the former part.</p>
                  <p>The fourth <hi>Objection</hi> is from the duration of the new Heaven or new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is ſaid to be ſet without date, and to be for ever and ever, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.5. and to remain before God as an immoveable pillar, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.22. and <hi>Daniel</hi> calls it an everlaſting Dominion, which a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom expreſly bounded with a thouſand years can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, that there is no concluding Argument in this neither; for what is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture, than by the terms ever, yea ever and ever, and everlaſting, to mean ſome ſpace of time, yea and that ſometimes a term ſhort of a thouſand years too. Is not the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion called a perpetual and everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.13. The Prieſt-hood an everlaſting Prieſt-hood? <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.15. The Temple is ſaid to continue for ever? 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:152899:122"/> 8.13. with everlaſting Gates, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7, 9 The ſervitude of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> till the Jubile for ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.17. <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.39. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was given the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to inhabit for ever and ever, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.5. The ſeventy years Captivity is called perpetual, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.9.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I conclude, that there is no Ground or warranty at all upon ſuch niceties to draw ſuch ſingular concluſions, and not only to ſlit, ſeparate, and divide theſe States, but to ſet them at ſuch a vaſt diſtance, a thouſand years at leaſt, which indeed makes a wide breach in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and run upon that Rock of ſetting the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ſo far off, as to be paſt already, which I conceive is not to be reconciled either with the ſpirits interpretation in this Book, the ſcope of the place, or other Scriptures, and neceſſarily runs upon a thouſand inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>The fifth <hi>Objection</hi> is, that out of the <hi>Rev</hi> 20.11. where becauſe it is ſaid the Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fled away at Chriſts appearance, ſo as there was no more place for them: therefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it is the ſame Heaven and Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the 21.1. is ſaid to have paſt away, as the firſt Heaven and Earth to make way for the new Heaven and Earth or new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I conceive they are as different in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as they are in their times, being a thouſand years diſtant at leaſt from each other; the one
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:152899:123"/> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. being the miſtical Heaven and Earth, outward, viſible Rule, Dignity and Soveraignty, ſuch as the Dragon, Beaſt and falſe-prophet have exerciſed in the fourth Monarchy, as is before large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, not only from the ſcope of the place, and many Scriptures of the Prophets, but from the excellent obſervation of Mr. <hi>Mead,</hi> Aſſemblies Annotations. Mr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> &amp;c. in this place; for now the old Heavens and Earth in the fourth Monarchy being paſt away in order to its Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis taking place, the new Heavens and Earth or new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Saints Reign, or fifth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in the thouſand years, which the 65. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17. &amp;c. fully demonſtates, evincing it to be a ſtate, wherein there is to be Building, Planting, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and giving in Marriage, enjoyment of peace and plenty by the Saints and Elect, which are utterly inconſiſtent to the perſonal Reign of Chriſt, after the erecting of the white Throne in the Judgment day. The other in the 20.11. is the material old Heaven and Earth, that at Chriſts coming and perſonal appearing paſs away, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. where it is ſaid that the day of the Lord ſhall come, as a Thief in the night, in which the Heaven ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with ſervent heat, the Earth alſo, and the works therein ſhall be burnt up, and the Heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that this intendeth the material Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth, beyond all diſpute the ſeventh verſe tells us; that as the former Heaven and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:152899:123"/> Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the old world was by Gods Word deſtroyed by Water, ſo the Heaven and Earth that is now, by the ſame word are kept in ſtore, reſerved unto fire againſt the day of Judgment and perdition of ungodly men, and this in order to thoſe material new Heavens and Earth, that in this time of reſtitution of all things muſt take place, wherein Chriſt and all his Saints in the general Reſurrection and Judgement (as this <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11.) in that his miſphatical Kingdom (after his Davidical or Monarchical kingdom is over) ſhall Reign and Judge. Now the ſame Heaven and Earth, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, ſhall at Chriſts preſence paſs away with a great noiſe, <hi>John</hi> ſaith here, The Earth and the Heaven fled away at his preſence (or from his face) erecting now his white Throne, where he will judge the wicked and ungodly.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth and laſt <hi>Objection</hi> that is to be ſpoken to, and indeed is ſignificantly urged, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that if this thouſand years ought to be eſteemed the new Heaven and Earth, how then can it bring forth ſuch Vipers and Monſters, as <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog,</hi> who muſt either be of the firſt or old Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, or of the new: Not of the new; for they muſt remain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. And if of the old, how then are they paſt away?</p>
                  <p>To which I reply, that this new Heaven and Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the Monarchical Rule of Chriſt in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:152899:124"/> the hands of the Saints over the Nations of the Earth, hath its date and laſteth but a thouſand years, during alſo which time Satan is bound, <hi>viz.</hi> all worldly Empire put down, no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hands of any, but Saints, and the Nations all in perfect ſubjection: But it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the decree of Heaven, that at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of theſe thouſand years, Satan ſhall be looſed, and then the Heatheniſh Nations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſubjecting to Chriſts Rule, will univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally rebel and conſpire againſt it; becauſe they are only under, and in ſubjection to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the new Heavenly ſtate, but never of it, none of thoſe that ever entred the holy City, and ſo in order to the fulfilling of Prophecie, to the diſſolution of the old material Heavens and Earth, and bringing on the new, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the miſphatical Kingdom. All theſe wicked Rebels muſt not only by Chriſts appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be deſtroyed by fire (who cometh in flaming fire to take vengeance of all that know not God, nor obey his Goſpel) but alſo with the ſame fire will the material old Heaven and Elements (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) melt with heat, and paſs away; the Earth alſo and all its works be burnt up, that the new Heavens and new Earth according to promiſe may come on. And ſo will the Lord Jeſus and the Saints continue therein to judge the quick and dead in that his miſphatical Kingdom, till he deliver all up into the hands of the Father, that God may be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, As to the Natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Say not within your ſelves we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father but bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance and amendment of Life,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.37, 38. <hi>and do the works of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>otherwiſe you are of your Father the Devil,</hi> ver. 44. <hi>Abrahams</hi> true ſeed which are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeed of promiſe, is the believer, whether Jew or Gentile; for if they are Chriſts they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed and heirs according to promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.29.4.28. Therefore whether to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to any Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Priviledge out of Chriſt doth not deny the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe Scriptures, and thwart the new Teſtament, is ſubmitted to conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The diſtinction of Tribes was alſo Fleſhly and Typical, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>If any other man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he hath whereof he may truſt in the Fleſh, I more: Circumciſed the eighth day, of the Tribe of</hi> Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <hi>an Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> which he eſteemed but dung and dogs meat for the excellency and Knowledge of Chriſt. And therefore the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>That henceforth know we no man after the fleſh, yea though we have known
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:152899:126"/> Chriſt after the fleſh, yet henceforth know we him no more:</hi> The only Tribe now is the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> into which the Kingſhip, Prieſt-hood, is transferred, the believers being Kings and Prieſts, the true Jew that is only of that Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> being the inward Spiritual heart Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed Jew: therefore whether to hold forth any Principles or interpret any Scriptures to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a diſtinction of Tribes in this new body and Corporation under the Goſpel, whereby the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fleſhly typical ſeed was diſtinguiſhed of old, is not to thwart Goſpel-principles, and no leſs than to deny Chriſt, to be come in the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The City <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> which under the Law was called the holy City was typical, and ſo reputed Carnal under the Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as belonging to <hi>Hagar</hi> the Bond-woman, was to be done away, and is therefore put in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is above, <hi>viz.</hi> the new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is the mother of us all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.25, 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. compared with <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. being an explanation to each other.</p>
                     <p>Therefore whether now for any to interpret any Scriptures in the Prophets ſpeaking of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> a holy City to be meant a material City that is to be rebuilt, and to become a Metropolis again amongſt the Nations, and to be eſteemed a holy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not certainly to advance again Mount <hi>Zina</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> is not to ſet up <hi>Hagar</hi> above <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> to bring in the City of Bondage again to the defacing the free City the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152899:127"/> is above all, and the mother of us all, from whence alone the free Denizens the Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles are to fetch their freedoms and Liberties?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That Territory called the Nation of <hi>Iudea,</hi> whether the leſſer contained betwixt <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and the Weſt Sea, and from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Berſheba,</hi> or the greater from Sea to Sea, <hi>viz.

Euphrates</hi> to the end of the Earth, taking in the <hi>Arabias,</hi> &amp;c. that was called the Land of Promiſe; the Land of Reſt was typical and fleſhly, and belonged therefore to the old Covenant, and is done away and no more to be expected by the ſeed of Promiſe, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the Believers, (though it is not denyed but that the natural Jew may according to the Letter become a Nation, and dwell even in that Territory again) becauſe they now enter into, and muſt yet enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. with that promiſed Land typt out, the Believer whether Jew or Gentile being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the only choſen Generation, Holy Nation, peculiar people in the world, that either are or ever ſhall be, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. therefore whether for any to aſſert any Doctrines to make the Verge or Bounds of any Countrey upon Earth to be now in the Goſpel days to be ſet apart for holy Ground, and entred and poſſeſſed in chief, and by way of difference and diſtinction by any of the ſeed, is not to keep up <hi>Moſes,</hi> and out Chriſt, and to tye up Chriſts Kingdom to a particular Region
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152899:127"/> that is to be over the whole World unbounded, unlimited.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That Prieſt-hood under the Law to which belonged the Temple, Service, Altar, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices was typical and done away by Chriſt; for as the Apoſtle reaſons, that Prieſt-hood being done away and changed and brought into another Tribe, there remains of neceſſity a change of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> of all the appurtenances thereto.</p>
                     <p>Therefore is the Believer the Royal Prieſt-hood under Chriſt the high Prieſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.9 <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1. they are the Temple, Tabernacle, the Mount <hi>Zion, Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Their Prayers, Praiſes, Alms, Bodies, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are the Sacrifices that in this new Teſtament-miniſtration are to be only offered as the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervices upon that Altar; whereof they have no right to eat, that ſerve at the Carnal Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.11. Therefore whether to bring in any other Seed, Tribe, City, Nation, Prieſt-hood then what is eſtabliſhed by Chriſt in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not to bring in <hi>Moſes</hi> again, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build that partition Wall that Chriſt Jeſus by his death pulled down, is not to harden the poor Jews in their enmity and ſuperſtition, and to caſt a ſtumbling Block before the Gentile believer, to the bringing back again into bondage?</p>

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152899:129"/> all the Countreys that pertain to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and made all that were preſent in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſerve, even to ſerve the Lord their God; <hi>And all his dayes they departed not from following the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> 2 Chron. 34.4, 5, 6.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:152899:129"/> and <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. To them alſo, by all which is it not manifeſt, that whatever the received opinion has been, that ſince <hi>Iſraels</hi> captivity, they were never heard of, that there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time of many of the Tribes, and in <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> time a hundred years after, many more of them inhabiting their own Land, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one King; and in <hi>Zerubabells</hi> and the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi> time afterwards all of <hi>Davids</hi> Line; as <hi>Math.</hi> 1. and <hi>Luke the</hi> 3.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Miſtically did the believing Jews and Iſraelites, whereof there were great numbers, gather under <hi>David</hi> their King, the Lord Jeſus in conjunction with the believing <hi>Gentile</hi> in his new Teſtament, Rule, Government and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, which in expreſs Terms is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> to be reſtoring the fallen Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>David.

                  <p>Therefore whether for any to aſſert, becauſe the Prophets ſo often ſpeak of a Conjunction of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> and a return into their own Land, to the building City and Temple, and injoyment of legal rites and ceremonies under
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:152899:130"/> one King, that therefore thoſe prophecies are to be yet fulfilled in the Letter, is not an abſolute miſtake and ſuch a ſence, that neceſſarily offers violence to the principles of the Goſpel, and not to be reconciled with the firſt Rule before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: and not onely hardens their deluded Jews in their expectation of a Temporary Meſſiah, of whom they have had already ſo many Impoſtures, but teaches the Gentile Believer to Judaize alſo, of which there have been ſo many in theſe Latter dayes, though in a miſtical and Spiritual ſence, all thoſe prophecies may admit of a larger and further Accompliſhment, as before, and which with the conſideration of what is fulfilled in the Letter as before may reconcile all.</p>
